"\"Valve looks to be teasing the imminent release of Counter-Strike 2, if we're reading this cheeky Tweet correctly. The game has been in limited, closed beta testing since March, when it was initially announced. Valve always said that Counter-Strike 2 would be available for everyone sometime in the summer, so there's only really one way to interpret this Tweet from the official Counter-Strike account. \"\"What are you doing next Wednesday?\"\" it asks, referring to September 27. That would <em>technically</em> put it outside of the summer season, since that ends September 23. But we don't need to be literal here.

Natural Sensitivity Scale: use \"\"Pixels Per 360°\"\" to calibrate both the Flick Stick and Gyro's real world angles into in-game angles. In this way, your Gyro Natural Sensitivity Multiplier can be consistent across games, with \"\"Pixels Per 360°\"\" being the isolated tuning value for each game. 1€ Filter: Smoothed low level gyro noise without adding delay. Speed Deadzones and Precision Zones will allow you to tune preferences for hand shake during fine aim. Yaw vs. Roll Blend: you can now blend between \"\"Yaw\"\" or \"\"Roll\"\" mode. Gyro Momentum Option: releasing your gyro activation button can maintain some rotation from the gyro. Tune the momentum on independent axes to bias toward horizontal movement vs vertical movement. Gyro sensor timestamps are now used resulting in better overall accuracy of the Gyro. Gyro over Bluetooth improvements - gyro motion is extrapolated when Bluetooth packets are delayed, resulting in smoother movement. Any error incurred is corrected gradually over time, during high speed movement to avoid \"\"Ouija effect\"\" during precise aiming. Fixed Roll axis on Steam Deck for legacy \"\"As Mouse\"\".

Моддер Halk Hogan PL спустя всего две недели после анонса выпустил первую версию мода HD Reworked Project для Starfield.,"Starfield can be a rather gorgeous game at times. Peer too closely, however, and you'll start to notice the cracks in the facade. Many of the game's textures and effects don't hold up to close inspection, while a lot of the faces have a rather plastic look to them - something you'll likely become very aware of, given how close in proximity Bethesda NPCs like to stand while you're chatting to them.

Though it's technically possible, if you want to fly organically between planets in the same system without going into the menus, it takes hours upon hours of real time.

As it stands, jumping in and out of the Starmap every time you want to travel breaks up the journey - that wonderful sense of traveling that you get in Skyrim, Fallout, and the rest of the Elder Scrolls series, is rarer in Starfield without seamless flying.

The Magic Mirror allows you to change up your appearance whenever you’d like, however many times you’d like. There are some restrictions: your appearance, voice, pronouns and nether regions can be changed, but your race/subrace and body type cannot. Origin characters, hirelings and full illithids cannot use the Magic Mirror. Cosmetic modifications that are a consequence of your gameplay choices will persist – hag got your eye?

You're not going to be surprised to hear that combos are an incredibly important aspect of pretty much all fighting games, but that doesn't mean they're an easy thing to pull off. You need to memorise all the potential inputs, and you obviously have to consider what your opponent is going to do. But sometimes, when things line up just right, you can pull off a touch of death combo, and almost completely obliterate whoever you're up against. A little bit of context: in fighting games, touch of death combos essentially put your opponent in a position where they can't react at all due to constantly being stunlocked, letting you whittle down their health to zero, or at the very least close to zero. They are seriously difficult to pull off and often have tonnes of prerequisites, but if you do manage to do so it's wildly impressive.
