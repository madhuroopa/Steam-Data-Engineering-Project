1716740,Wait a few more years when there is more content added to the game and bugs are fixed Look how long it took Cyberpunk and NMS to get right Same applies to this game sadly,neg,2023-09-24
1716740,As a long time Bethesda fan I was rather disappointed with this game There is a lot of game here and a lot of different main and side quests The ship building and base building are fun but get boring after a while The whole space battle aspect is quite empty and boring where I try to stay out of the ship as much as possible Not sure why they thought they needed as many planets as they do most of them are you just running around an empty planet for a couple hours trying to find something to do I feel like the worst part is the lack of exploration needed to complete the game In Skyrim you need to physically go to the location before you can teleport there which most times youll find a cave or a  town to explore and get distracted by But in this game its you get the questteleport to the shipteleport to the quest locationkill the 20 guys in the building and then reverse the whole thing to go back The amount of time you spend in loading screens is crazy considering how fast they load On the positive side the characters and backstorys are well done in this game There is a huge assortment of guns and armor The gunplay overall is pretty great in comparison to fallout But the game was a pretty big letdown from the kings at Bethesda Would only recommend if you get it for free,neg,2023-09-24
1716740,A mostly fun game filled to the brim with bugs and technical issues After finally finishing my first playthrough I cant help but feel a little disappointed The exploration in this game is terrible I do not think that I found any new location while free roaming after the first 1015 hours A majority of the locations are tied to quest lines which is really unfortunate Will gladly jump back in for another go after some patches and DLC comes out but for now I am glad my time is done,neg,2023-09-24

1086940,Seems like it could be a great game Their were no bugs from what I could tell the graphics are good and the music is great Despite these things the beginning is too tough to draw you in and the mechanics are silly Long rest to use spells and skills again No thank you I was expecting something closer to Divinity 2 and was disappointed,neg,2023-09-24

1086940,This game is very mediocre It doesnt do anything special at all 610 at best Uninteresting characters sloppy writingstory and uninteresting lore imo Just because a game isnt full of microtransactions doesnt make it great Also the game feels unfinished and rushed in act 3 The characters are all horny as hell Lae zel will want to f your character after 2 minutes of talking to her Even the Mind flayer Emperor whos technically soulless wants to fuck your character  Definitely the most mediocre game ever made If all you care about is visuals then this is the best looking CRPG of all time  Ive not got much experience with CRPGs but Ive played 3 including BG3 and this is probably the worst one Expeditions Rome is a far better CRPG than this CRPG in combatgameplay story writing characters and world buidling Id recommend that game over this one if BG3 dissapoints you,neg,2023-09-24

1971870,The game itself is great but the matchmaking is horrible Needs better net code for sure and the lobbies are a joke,neg,2023-09-24
1971870,Marvel Story Not good,neg,2023-09-24
1971870,honestly just a copy and paste even the moves and fatalities players are bogus and use infinite combos all the time all the cool unshockable skins are locked behind online play kameos are just bullshiz combo extenders for people who try way to hard and ruin the game for people trying to have fun seems they went backwards from mk 11,neg,2023-09-24
1971870,The game is imKomplete with basically zero single player content  For a fighting game thats normally fine But MK has set a standard of having at least something decent  The game performs HORRIBLY on PC and you will need a high end GPU to play on anything but LOW and get 60 FPS  Gameplay is typical NRS trash horribly unbalanced and gimmicky  Bug ridden lag fest  In a year with Fighting Games like SF6 Tekken 8 coming out and ARCSYS titles like DBFZ and GGstrive still being supported  You cant really justify buying this game let alone putting time into it  The normal low IQ MK sycophants who dont know what frames are and have never stepped foot in a training mode will eat it up  And dont even get me started there  If you enjoy labbing set ups and using the training dummy the myriad of qualify of life issues will have you wanted to fatality yourself in 5 minutes  Save your time and money,neg,2023-09-24
1971870,Please Please PLEASE give this port a patch this performance is actually ridiculous,neg,2023-09-24
1971870,Unfinished  rushed product I have been fan on MK since sega days and dont remember being this disappointed in my entire life with the franchise DO NOT buy this game at the current stage I trust Ed Boons word when he said we worked on this game the longest and it will show but it was just another lie to sell their product sadly There is too many bugs lack of customization cut content glitches ping  fps issues but none of the devs said anything about the issues so far they are just being radio silent pretending game is perfect so it doesnt hurt the sales,neg,2023-09-24
1971870,The overall gameplay for MK1 is pretty fun Characters gain access to more special moves now that they arent variations and being able to only select three additional special moves eg MK11 However with the gameplay being fun the online play for the game is abysmal There are frame rate drops to stutters as well as having desyncs against your opponent if you want to rematch them I dont understand how this game released as is the online is horrible if you want to keep playing online  you basically have to keep finding new opponents after winning or losing after one match Havent really tried invasion nor story mode but if your mostly play online like I do I would probably hold off buying this game for now At least until NRS releases a big fix to fix these issues,neg,2023-09-24
1971870,I have been waiting for this game for a while but I have to give a negative review cause unfortunately it brought on only the things I didnt like about MK11 and removed the things I liked For instance Kameo fighters really ruin the aesthetics of MK IMO and fewer possibilities of customisation and fewer combos are also annoying,neg,2023-09-24
1971870,This game is not a reboot of MK like it was advertised This is MK12 a direct continuation of the same story in MK11,neg,2023-09-24

1971870,Still unable to play online with a proper network setup not a single match after 20 hours of game time no info on patches and solutions Holdout on spending the large amounts of cash for this premium product Extremely poorly optimized on PC,neg,2023-09-24

1272080,Fix your damn game at this point refund everyone for the cost of the game and make it free we all know youre planning on selling skins you will make your money there so stead of giving us a laggy trash rushed game you cant even join muitl matches it errors you out of the lobbys  if you have in since of pribe you would refund everyone and give this too us for free other wise im sure most people are going to refund this and you will lose player base then you wont make money on all those skins you were going to sell for real money,neg,2023-09-24

1272080,I cant even get into a fucking server,neg,2023-09-24
1272080,While the game itself is fun and has tons of potential the fact that it is extremely difficult to play the game due to server issues makes it hard to recommend to others Once the server issues are fixed I expect Payday 3 to be a fantastic game However we are nearly a week after launch and the game is unplayable due to server issues,neg,2023-09-24
1272080,4 days past release and the matchmaking still doesnt work 9 times out of 10 I am giving up and requesting a refund If the devIT team somehow salvages this mess offline mode PLEASE I may try it again down the road because the miniscule amount of gameplay I got was fun For now this is not worth 40 USD by any means,neg,2023-09-24

1272080,It should be criminal to release a game online only today most games end up DOA or BOA The game deserves every inch of hate They did very little to look back at what made Payday 2 originally a great game Payday 3 is a actual coinflip on release Maybe itll work or maybe it wont Now 100 we arent getting any classic levels back either since the voice of Bain and the character doesnt work for Starbreeze anymore the leveling system with this game is up there with Payday 1 and its do challenges to get better equipment it was a bad cookie cutter system In which Payday 2 improved upon you play it ur way and you level up passively This game will unfortunately fall under GaaS Games as a Service and it will also rely on central server if it goes down or even shuts down forever Your progress and time poured into the game might or will just disappear until put back online Starbreeze will have the biggest fire under their butt in a long while I bet and its deserved aswell Ive seen enough online only games die Please dont make this another one,neg,2023-09-24
1272080,Ive never come across server issues myself The game released with next to nothing new when it comes to a payday game give it about a year in the oven for the dlc to come through and itll probably be a good partner to payday 2,neg,2023-09-24

1599340,The game can be glitchy and technical support is unresponsive and youll find there is class discrimination with trying to find groups with certain classes There also needs to be other ways to level up since finding higher level gear is locked behind finding raid groups who can be unkind and also discriminatory It is a beautiful game but the game system and service could be much better I play very casually now only because Ive already invested money into it,neg,2023-09-24

1599340,Worst community in gaming Everyone you match with acts like the fate of the universe hangs within the balance of finishing a raid in 2 minutes flat and not 2 minutes and 15 seconds Its as if they have something super important to do afterwards like play lost ark for the next 14 hours straight while seethinghating every second of it,neg,2023-09-24

1627720,its good until bosses otherwise fun unique weapons some need adjusting weapons feel weak and throwing objects are too strong,neg,2023-09-24
1627720,Breeze past rather simple enemies struggle fairly against mini boss level enemies admire the world design in spite of jank barriers and throw yourself at bosses until you memorize all of their attacks and the weird timings Red attacks that must be perfect guarded the wind up for your own guard the tight window to perfect guard and the extreme tracking make this hard to recommend,neg,2023-09-24
1627720,It kind saddens me that I progressively lost interest as the game went on The parrying became more demanding as the bosses got harder and this is coming from someone who does not enjoy parrying that much The dodge button is effective but youre less inclined to use it when you know building up someones posture which will lead to more damage There is a good incentive to parry but when it becomes the only way to play the game it starts to get boring and redundant The areas were not that fun to explore and the balance towards the endgame just loses itself For this studios first souls like game its not bad but I think FromSoftware is still on top when it come to this genre,neg,2023-09-24
1627720,Crashes everywhere,neg,2023-09-24
1627720,i really wish there was a way to say mixed feelings because i like this game its fun but god are the bosses just terribly designed i love the level design it feels like a soul game but the bosses are so unfun to fight with telegraphing being extremely limited other than the big WATCH OUT RED ATTACK move most movesets in the game come down to the enemys charging up a large attack that is telegraphed and then randomly snapping the weapon down at you without alot of time to react it gets worse because of the guard penalty making it so if you miss one parry in a combo you will not be able to parry the rest because of the penalty you just cant pull your weapon up fast enough to parry ontop of that there isnt alot of incentive to parrying you dont get anything from it other than building up the enemys stagger meter maybe if they made it so when you do a perfect parry you get a little charge on your healing just so there is a incentive to playing risky like that and some of the weapons feel bad to use like the wrench does huge numbers but its range is so low you have to literally be hugging the enemy to do damage it just feels bad to use other weapons are fine mostly i do really hope that some things are changed in the future it just needs to be a little more polished,neg,2023-09-24
1627720,Art design in this game is incredible I had a great time in between the bosses but bosses in this game are badly designed in way that the devs just want to torture the players Boss mechanics are ridiculos and seems like they are implemented without any good reason other than to punish players Ye ye git good Unfortunately im not a adhd zoomer,neg,2023-09-24

1085660,I have played Destiny since its original launch Love the game customization excellent PVE However after so many years so much money Bungle has made they STILL fail to fix server issues and spend those BILLIONS theyve milked outta players to fix an issue even after its gone on for weeks if you dont already play its HUNDREDS to unlock everything up to current content Dont waste the money or time just get a game that has stable servers and actually puts the money you spend on it into the game Its far too late for most of us players but anyone debating on trying it please dont for your own sake Bungle doesnt care they just want to milk us all till the servers light on fire and call it a day Anyone got a can of gas btw,neg,2023-09-24

1085660,I Do really wish i could recommend this game as it can be so much fun however due to the recent weekends of various glitchs and DDOS attacks its evident bungie needs to look at improved security for there servers to make this game playable for the people who have PAID money to get you to play all the seem to care about is getting people to pre order the next expansion the final shape regardless of the state of the current game,neg,2023-09-24

1085660,Not worth it Initially it was a fantastic game but Bungie has vaulted past content players have purchased making it so you cant access the content you paid for The new content is subpar if you can even get into the game as the servers are constantly a nightmare giving players random error codes The base Game was 99 buck for the collectors edition and each additional expansion is not free but another 99 bucks Save yourself the headache and time and find a better game,neg,2023-09-24

1172470,Respawns gunplay and movement are simply unmatched No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound feel and look as good as the guns in Apex It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex Its truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer However heres a big and stinky but EA These two letters when put next to each other strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers The game is currently riddled with bugs hackers a scamdominated meta stale game modes pisspoor matchmaking and more What does EA make respawn focus on instead Pumping out more skins and collection events This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard with recolored skins littering the shop and events Meanwhile Mobile has 3 more legends than us a highly  and I mean HIGHLY  requested team deathmatch mode and tons of other cool features that the consolePC versions can only have wet dreams about Thank you EA You truly have the reverse Midas touch where everything you touch turns into piles of doodoo,neg,2023-09-24
1172470,Apex Legends is a disappointing game that fails to live up to the hype The graphics are bland and uninspired the controls are clunky and unresponsive and the gameplay is repetitive and boring The selection of weapons and characters is limited and the matchmaking system is unreliable frequently matching players with people who are much higher or lower level than they are The ingame microtransactions are also a major problem as players are constantly bombarded with ads for new skins weapons and other cosmetic items Overall I wouldnt recommend Apex Legends to anyone looking for a fun and engaging multiplayer experience,neg,2023-09-24

1172470,Respawn is not the same company that made Titanfall 2 anymore This is published by EA so you know theres no real progression unless you spend ungodly amounts of money for skins that dont look good You would think for a game with such good movement EA would realize how good this game could be Unfortunately the pros in this game arent good enough to move to another game and any new players immediately leave because this game also lags like crazy There is literally no reason to play this game I have played it since launch and its not like its gotten a 20 or health update to the game Im begging you please just dont play this game But if you do add me I guess,neg,2023-09-24
