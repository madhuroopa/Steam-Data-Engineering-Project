Honestly, for any Dead by Daylight fan, this is a pretty big deal. Dead by Daylight first launched in 2016 with an array of Killers and Survivors, and has been the host of countless horror collaborations since. Boot up the game and you\u2019ll find Amanda from SAW, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Michael Myers from Halloween, and that\u2019s just to name a few. Back in the day, an Alien collaboration with Dead by Daylight seemed completely off the cards. Fans have been asking for it for God knows how long, and after the Fortnite x Alien collaboration in 2021, fans have only been more desperate. Whether licensing or development issues got in the way, we don\u2019t know, but whatever was the case doesn't matter anymore, as the long-awaited Alien crossover is finally happening. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/dead-by-daylight-finally-collaborates-with-alien-after-years-of-fans-requesting-it\">Read more</a> ",
