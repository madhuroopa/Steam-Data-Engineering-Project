1282100,Im not too big a fan of most shooters but Ive been looking forward to this one since I finished Remnant from the Ashes It hasnt disappointed at all in fact it has a lot of quality of life improvements from the previous game Im not finished with the story yet but the worlds are huge and youll likely have to play through multiple times to get the whole plot of the separate worlds but that means you can play through with your friends and learn new things find new gear Its good,pos
1282100,"Great game with friends great sense of satisfaction when you finally kill a hard boss The boss mechanics are refreshing fun and challenging Many different type of equipments good replayability as maps bosses are randomise and choice matters

1282100,On retail the game was very good not to many bugs since recent patch achievements have been bugged I have over 30 guns no acheivements Crafted more than 20 mods no acheivement bosses have had terrible hit registration Turrets are still bugged hit dead targets Shooting into the air at nothingThe flamthrower does not work besides the biggest slowest ground bosses Completed Apocalypse Solo and duo no Worlds edge like wtf whats the point of playing the late game if everything is bugged Cmon devs fix these game breaking issues instead of making apocalypse easier and buffing classes just fix them Game is amazing just current state is way under par,pos

1282100,The most disappointing sequel Dunno what everyone is praising here there is a boss that is literally rotating squares Absolutely terrible in comparison to the first game Talk about creatively bankrupt also to everyone praising this garbage you really need to bring your standards up because this is terrible,neg
1282100,"This game is everything I hate in video games nowadays yes really I hope you like long texts as this will explain to you the game experience if you preplan on playing to the final boss and uninstalling like I did and stuck to doing Youre paying for gameplay nothing else

How this game handles lore is the same way Hades handles lore however I prefer Hades way as thats a Roguelike where Remnant is not If Remnant as a Soulslike was going to be like a Soulslike then as Elden Ring and Dark Souls I would be able to see ALL the lore in ONE run from start to final boss not have to rerun the game It would be fine to rerun the game if its new game plus and everything was the same one LONG game not a game where I gotta do the same thing again

I count dimensionsbiomes as an area not a varied layout of a map This has very few dimensions in your runs You spawn in different places but you see the same aesthetics again you just have different tilesets where the loot and enemies are randomized but it has the same aesthetic trash for these prices

I dont care about gameplay I dont care about how my character operates I am not going to grind gear I should have gotten to see EVERYTHING about the story in one run

I dont hate the game it was just a tiny bit enjoyable but not worth the price Trust me at least 30 of these hours is me groaning from seeing the same dimensions they go for too long rarely finding something new that is a biome This game is max 25 dollars not whatever these prices are supposed to be The dark souls games and Elden Ring all have more to show for the same price look at the price tags Are you seriously telling me that the game in terms of quality aesthetics visuals and innovations are worth these prices compared to the first game They are not The main story cut scenes and dialogue are awful and doesnt make any sense and if the story is side content focused I hate this even more I hate side content in games make important things story based not optional There is nothing new here You added weapons and limited how strong we could be and there is almost nothing to see areaswise in one run there is nothing new here compared to other games or the first This games staying uninstalled I dont care Im not replaying this even if Im missing out on story the ending makes lore obsolete its worthless and Im not looking back

Someone said this is a side step rather than a step back and I agree with that Maybe this gets better but it wont become the way I would like the game to be you already set the stage and gotten this far so Im not expecting anything designed more towards the more rare people like me who dont care about gameplay or becoming strong I was here for the story in only one run and was disappointed

Remnant 1 but different not better",neg
1282100,Game is not saving incredibly frustrating,neg
1282100,"Where do i even Start

Yes this game has Remnant features Yes it does to some extent do fun in CoOp Yes you do have multiple Worlds Yes you do have multiple classes  and now comes the big BUT

The Problem this game has in my opinion is that firstly the hitboxes are all over the place and you have to play around with rings to compensate for that

What does make Remnant 1 still better than 2 Oh tons of things For example You get more Weapons more mods more Armors more traits that are way more useful I dont really know what they thought when they did this game and i tried to like this game fro start really alot but firstly the dog from the healer class didnt work properly sometimes crashes happened alot and i for myself had still some performance issues with my i9 12900k 32GB Ram and 3080 RTX Its a shame they streched the end of the game so long like in most new games to make gameplay hours longer than the game usually has We explored literally everything and still it felt like the game was either rushed or with the idea of having NO clue what to do in this new game although i still loved the DESIGN not the gameplay mechanics of the bosses it still doesnt compensate for all the things i stated above

Fact for me is this game is only a 45 max 5 out of 10 rating worth I still have more fun coop with Remnant 1 than with the second game

If you dont mind the stated above and you dont care about any of this and just want some coop action go for it but if u expect something similar or better than Remnant 1 then  imo dont bother with it unless its on sale

Sad to see that the first one is still better than the second one",neg
1282100,As much as I would love to play this game in full the constant performance issues are simply too glaring to ignore The games performance varies drastically In my experience the game takes over 5 minutes to launch and each loading screen takes over a minute and a half to transition Textures are popping in all over the place with some objects like cars rendering at in extremely poor quality right next to you Overall the gameplay feels good in the few spots where game performance was somewhat stable It might be worth revisiting at a later date but certainly not in its current state,neg
1282100,I still dont know if I like this game or not Im going to not recommend the game because ultimately its a lot of annoying mechanics and bad hitboxes that make the game just frustrating to deal with A TON of super cheap death mechanics The game purposefully tricking you to kill you more Ive beaten elden ring demons souls dark souls almost done with dark souls 3 and played a lot sekiro These games dont even come close to the frustration of this game Bad dodging that works sometimes and doesnt work other times Things shouldnt hit you and they do,neg
1282100,Exercise in Frustration the game,neg
1282100,Game is good but I cant recommend it because for no reason its crushing to desktop all the time I will change my review when devs will patch it,neg
1282100,Horribly optimized Furthermore recent updates have broken the game Bugs are everywhere especially in multiplayer Trait points which are used as level up points vanish randomly i have maxed out the same traits more than a dozen times Majority of bosses feel like they are made for multiple people and not for solo Lastly the one problem that stands out to me is how you acquire itemsclassesweapons and basically anything in the game 90 of items you can obtain you have to find As someone who has played all of the dark souls games this doesnt seem like a problem until you realize how hard it is to find these items There is one class called the Archon  that had to literally be datamined I realize the devs did this on purpose but i feel like it is a great way to represent the game You are required to look up guides if you want any new weaponsclasses or armor,neg
1282100,"Pros 
Dark Souls with guns

Cons 
Frustrating bullet sponge bosses with to many oneshot mechanics
More than half the classesall the new and interesting ones are extremely hidden and have to be unlocked You pretty much have to look up guides for unlocking all the classes
Armor system in the game feels really watered down you almost never find anything new here
Whenever you find a new gun you cant actually use it because it will be so under leveled it will be useless  
Game is super stingy with currency making it very hard to experiment with any items
Enemies have a tendency to swarm and stun lock you in melee 
Most enemies will kill you in just a couple hits even on the lowest difficulties",neg

1086940,"I dont even know where to start on this one  I am trying really hard to like this game given how much I love Baldurs Gate 1 and 2 but the lack of polish on this game is startling for a company as well respected as Larian

Cinematic cutscenes are a buggy mess where my first cinematic had my character jutting out perpendicular to the pod they were resting in then teleporting to the ground rather than jumping out of it  The text is especially broken where it can disappear so quickly I cant tell which of my companions approved or disproved  Another egregious moment was when my game crashed so I had to reload an earlier point but going forward the scene I was at acts as if Ive failed a check I passed the first goaround even when it says I passed the skill  No amount of reloading has fixed this Im just permanently locked out of ever seeing that result again

What this game really fails at is readability and not necessarily in the sense of being able to read the text but rather Larians surprising lack of any real communication to the core systems and mechanics of the game  Tutorials are extremely lackluster and often close out before you can read them  And the UI doesnt particularly lend itself to helping the player learn it  The irony is that 5e is as I understand it the most accessible of the DnD systems  In their efforts to streamline what is already a streamlined ruleset Larian forgot to actually design the game so people who dont play 5e know what is happening

Character creationlevel ups are a good example of this  Even when youre custom building a character the game just auto fills out everything for you and then expects you to dig through all of its windows and tabs to see what you want to personally change  This is a terrible concept for learning a system especially if like me you miss one of the sections and only find out later it was even an option to modify

The game is littered with a lot of really bizarre decisions like this that make the QoL justnot acceptable  Changing companions for example requires you to go to your camp speak to one of your current party members dismiss them then go talk to the companion you want in your party and recruit them  How exactly have we regressed in party management this poorly

It feels like Larians approach to actually teaching the player their game is to justthrow them in the blender and close the lid  There is a good game here buried underneath the piles of clunky UI and just bad design  I really want to like this game but its justbroken  Ill try to get through it to the end but honestly Im rather upset about these skill check bugs  It feels like the skill checks are pointless if nothing changes based on success or failure  Mind Im sure this is a bug because it absolutely should  But when you play through the exact same scene multiple times succeed at the same rolls as before but then get a failure state because something in the game is broken it can be difficult to engage with it

My hope in the coming months is that they will polish out the rough edges here  Like I said there is a good game underneath it but I really cant recommend it with all of this jank  Especially with a 60 dollar price tag",neg
1086940,"Dont get distracted by the genitals this game just isnt very good

Sure it has its occasional moments but I was hoping for an improvement to the Larian formula with a DD theme but what I got was a frustratingly horrid camera and UI coupled with clunky movementcontrols and an overabundance of environment puzzles that really cause this game to drag in a way that just puts me to sleep

Combat seems complex in its mechanics at first but is actually pretty simple in its execution so ultimately the ruleset is mostly just bloat  Then you have fights that can instagib you before you even start your turn because of the insane amount of RNG and youll be stuck reloading way more then you really should be  Hope you enjoy wasting 10 minutes on a fight only to have to get booted off a cliff or some other frustrating mechanic and forced to do it all over again

Conversation and story choice was heavily marketed but I havent seen much in choice at all conversations are generally pretty straight forward and choice comes down to who do you want to bang followed by cringey romance subplots that really dont add anything to the game  Oh youll be reloading conversations as well because the dialog doesnt always match your believed intention of your choice  I thought you just said there was no choice you may ask  In game choice generally comes down to do I want to fight or do I want to skip the fight with a modifier  A good spoilerfree example of this is when you use a skill modifier to talk your way out of a fight using the logic that noise would attract bigger monsters only to then refuse a quest to then just end up fighting the guy anyways  Oh well so much for consistency

I get it nerds are having seizures over this game and calling it the next coming of jesus and I really wanted to like this Ive wanted the next Dragon Age Origins masterpiece since that game came out this game is just not it  Not even in the slightest  Its a boring mess and people are overlooking its flaws because theyre so used to games being garbage microtransactionfests that when a game is actually structured like a game people turn on the blinders and blindly praise it simply for that fact",neg
1086940,no,neg
1086940,"Avoid multiplayer  AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE Till the devs have resolved the party issue where you cannot kick custom characters or remove them if they are dead from your party

I personally enjoy this game but I have it so i can play with others but this game doesnt allow for a drop in and drop out sort of game play which means after the first save with peoples own characters they are stuck forever in your party 

This for me is a very big issue and also prevent the game being enjoyed as a group 


HOWEVER the game is fine for single player 
Till this issue is resolved its a down vote from me",neg
1086940,"Multiplayer is bugged if you are playing on the same wifi 2 pcs in the same household Give it some time to work out the bugs because as of 852023 it does not work and multiplayer is the whole reason I purchased this game

Edit The problem is SteamJust turn off cloud saves make a copy of your precious saved game and then delete it After you test it successfully readd your save again Very tedious and I stand by my statement give it a few weeks or so to get all these game breaking bugs time to get patched 3


Unfortunately to ensure you wont encounter the issue you will have to turn off the games highly requested cloud save feature Here are the steps in order

    Turn off the cloud sync to Baldurs Gate 3 rightclick the game in Steam  click properties  general  steam cloud  tick off
    Remove the folder CUsersmyUserAppDataLocalLarian StudiosBaldurs Gate 3
    Start the game and do not enable the cloud sync

This fix will cause you to lose any progress youve made but your next playthrough will allow you to save the game and continue playing on that file",neg
1086940,"A few hours in and honestly the game is just meh

The story is fine but the characters arent super compelling or interesting so far  Many interactions can be pretty nonsense  Save 4 out of 5 people and the people will still be upset that you let one person get slapped  There are plenty of class specific options which is good though

The combat difficulty is all over the place if you dont do exactly what the devs want you to do for that encounter  5e combat is already pretty simple and this game doesnt help with it much  Your actions are kinda the same as 5e but some new ones that help but are kinda stupid and meant to just stop dex melee builds from working as well with the daze condition being easy to apply

The maps are also not that interesting to me to explore  Its something about how this company designs them that caused me not to be a fan of divinity original sin 2 as well

I would honestly say the pathfinder games are just more deep interesting enjoyable and well written so far  Its hard to avoid comparisons between games that do tabletop gaming systems  Ive also enjoyed Solasta Crown of the magister as a 5e game more so far",neg

1086940,"TLDR As of the August 3rd 2023 release the game is still effectively in early access in terms of performance and polish The game looks great and the gameplay is there but mechanics and controls feel unfinished

I can barely speak to the quality of the actual game but at launch the game is unstable and unpolished From equipment models magically floating behind or clipping into characters bugs persisting since beta core features like bardic inspiration being broken and savecorrupting crashes when being erroneously allowed to access camp early it is baffling that the launch date was moved UP 

The gameplay at least what works is fun Its just tragic that its built on a bootlegged version of the DOS client Basic modern features from party formation and PAUSING to accessibility settings like UI scaling are just absent

Having fully paying playtesters throughout a yearslong EA wasnt enough somehow Releasing the game in this state at its current pricing is predatory",neg
1086940,I uninstalled after two hours and got a refund  This genre is not for me at all  I found the gameplay and combat extremely slow and boring   The inventory menus are an ugly cluttered nightmare  theres no way I was going to learn how to manage all of that crap  After the alien ship crashed I found two companions and made my way into the church and found the first real combat encounter to be impossible  We were outnumbered 5 to 3 and I couldnt even kill their barbarian with all of my guys wailing on it  After 15 minutes of boring turnbased combat and running out of healing spells and potions I wiped  Screw that  Thats NORMAL difficultly  You get to use spells once and then you need to rest  Thats so dumb there should be a refillable mana bar or something  DD is for nerds dude I dont understand the appeal,neg
1086940,"Dont buy this game until the devs fix the horrific pathfinding AIs that cause every combat to end with your characters regrouping by sprinting into the dozens of hazards that were littered there during the fight instantly wiping the entire team

1172470,"I love this game solo q is rough if youre trying to rank up but the movement of Respawns games have always been amazing 

I cannot recommend this game to new players Even with the addition of the intro lobbies that are supposed to be new user friendly ie filled with bots as soon as youre out of it you will get stomped by high ranking preds and master ranked players regardless of the game mode The learning curve is steep and the community makes it steeper Smurfing is rampant and always will be and even if it werent an issue matchmaking will always put you in lobbies with someone whos macros and soft aim bot make them impossible to hit while theyre zeroed in on your forehead or predator ranked players 

If youre playing with friends it gets worse because matchmaking also prioritizes putting you with other 3 stacks who are all usually Master or higher",neg

1172470,Respawns gunplay and movement are simply unmatched No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound feel and look as good as the guns in Apex It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex Its truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer However heres a big and stinky but EA These two letters when put next to each other strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers The game is currently riddled with bugs hackers a scamdominated meta stale game modes pisspoor matchmaking and more What does EA make respawn focus on instead Pumping out more skins and collection events This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard with recolored skins littering the shop and events Meanwhile Mobile has 3 more legends than us a highly  and I mean HIGHLY  requested team deathmatch mode and tons of other cool features that the consolePC versions can only have wet dreams about Thank you EA You truly have the reverse Midas touch where everything you touch turns into piles of doodoo,neg
1172470,Apex Legends is a disappointing game that fails to live up to the hype The graphics are bland and uninspired the controls are clunky and unresponsive and the gameplay is repetitive and boring The selection of weapons and characters is limited and the matchmaking system is unreliable frequently matching players with people who are much higher or lower level than they are The ingame microtransactions are also a major problem as players are constantly bombarded with ads for new skins weapons and other cosmetic items Overall I wouldnt recommend Apex Legends to anyone looking for a fun and engaging multiplayer experience,neg

1172470,Respawn is not the same company that made Titanfall 2 anymore This is published by EA so you know theres no real progression unless you spend ungodly amounts of money for skins that dont look good You would think for a game with such good movement EA would realize how good this game could be Unfortunately the pros in this game arent good enough to move to another game and any new players immediately leave because this game also lags like crazy There is literally no reason to play this game I have played it since launch and its not like its gotten a 20 or health update to the game Im begging you please just dont play this game But if you do add me I guess,neg

   I dont wont and cant see recommending a game that doesnt provide matchmaking for similar experience levels  I made it to level 2 going against level 130s or even level 20s is downright slaughter  As stated youre either already good at the game or its a waste of time andor money",neg

1895880,Perfect,pos
1895880,If youre a Ratchet and Clank fan this is the game youve been waiting for The graphics are incredible the gunplay is typical RC gunplay and probably why you even like the series story is full of tropes but you dont come to the series for the story the character development of Rivet is very similar to the original seriess development of Ratchets development with Clank so that was kind of a cool homage I love this game and this series and hopefully Sony sees porting the series to the PC as a good idea in the future,pos
1895880,"Great game Looks absolutely incredible as if I was playing some funny animated space opera superhero movie

Perfect in length does not overstay its welcome Some may say that its too short but the amount of detail in levels and cutscenes is insane Its a very condensed and well designed experience New mechanics environments enemies characters are introduced every 5 minutes at least thats what it felt like Thanks to that the game doesnt get stale even in the late game

Theres some dreaded open world design leaking between the highly linear sections but theres not that many collectibles fortunately and the planets are fairly small and easy to explore The rewards are fun loregameplayfunnycosmetics stuff so the collectibles actually enhance the experience and dont feel like an unnecessary filler or a chore Theres some amount of grind in late game if you want to unlock every upgrade for every weapon but even then it took me only about 12 hours to finish all the upgrade trees before the last mission and it felt not at all necessary to grind them theres not even an achievement for it

The gameplay itself is relatively simple but a lot of fun 18 weapons in total can be unlocked throughout the game and the combat is designed in a way which encourages intuitive combos and a lot of weapon switching you run out of ammo on a single gun very quickly This makes the combat very engaging and fun even if it is perhaps a little too easy even on the highest difficulty

In regards of platforming it feels a little too restrictive scripted or even clunky sometimes however most of the time it feels great and has some memorable cinematic moments Whats impressive the game almost never stutters even when the character is travelling with high speed and switching between dimensions and so there was a lot of moments which I could describe with only a single word wow

Overall very fun game and very fun movie at the same time Highly recommended",pos
1895880,the game started out with a  few graphical bugs that quickly disappeared by changing the settings to high despite any bugs or glitches you may encounter this entry is still very stable as a PC port and though it may frustrate some players a swift restart doesnt fail to clear these bugs with the exception of the long and evident armor bug on the pirate world but that doesnt detract away from the gameplay experience at all nothing in life is perfect after all but as a sequel that continues this long standing series epic saga it certainly comes close I am very grateful to all those who worked on making this port remotely possible and i couldnt have asked for a better experience thank you insomniac and everybody else,pos

1895880,"First let me state I have been playing RnC since the OG and have made an effort to play every single one since and I havent been disappointed 

This game unfortunately does It has the feel of a RnC game it looks pretty and the controls are good Its missing a lot of substance that the other games do Why are the planets so short why is there so little arena stuff where it the extra mini games The whole game side and main content feels like a 13 or 12 of a real RnC game 

For the first time I never felt the desire to complete it in challenge mode the RYNO felt mid and it doesnt grab me like many of the old ones did 

TLDR Buy this game on sale its fun but incomplete",neg

1938090,"I wont be talking about Warzone since I just hate battle royales Nor will I talk about the monetization about the game you can find plenty of thoughts about it both on Steam and online

Overall not a bad game If you liked MW 2019 then go ahead and buy it But it does have some major flaws First is just performance and bugs and this is pretty prominent in the menu and campaign The menu runs like absolute trash This is the only game Ive played where the menu runs worse than the actual game And thats not including the just terrible design they have going on It feels more like Im trying to watch something on Hulu or Netflix than trying to play TDM or kill confirmed 

Then we have the bugs or rather a single bug In the campaign there were some points where at random the shader just glitches out and causes every single light source to go through walls making some sections of the campaign an absolute eye sore to look at Worse when you consider that the very same shader has to get optimized pretty much every other launch of the game Fixes seem to just work one day and not the next Fortunately however Ive yet to experience it in multiplayer only in the campaign

Speaking of multiplayer its ok I love how they kept the gun attachment system that was in MW 2019 but how they tried to flesh it out sorta sucks Rather than leveling a weapon up to get all the attachments for that gun you instead have to use other weapons to get attachments Sometimes having to use a similar gun in order to get the gun you want to use in question For example the HK weapons G3 MP5 etc are all under a set family If you want to use the MP5 you first have to get to a set level to unlock one weapon then level that weapon up to unlock another and doing that again before finally getting the MP5 I understand wanting to make the player use other weapons and play styles but this felt more like a chore and overall just grindy 

Map design is also leaning towards bad The times Ive gotten to piss because a map is far too open encouraging campingsniping happened way too often And this is exaggerated in some game modes like Hardpoint where you run around for a good chunk of time only to get killed instantly 

Another aspect of I dont like about the multiplayer is the movement Like in MW 2019 it feels too much like a movement shooter and not in a good way When I think of COD the only advanced movement you can do is vaulting at least and a dolphin dive at the most People running around with SMGs sliding around corners and magdumping is infuriating I just wished it was like the older games and stayed that way obligatory the kids yearn for titanfall sentence goes here",pos

And if you are out of shadow bans you get put right back into it after about 2 games if you get high kill streaks or are aboveaverage at the game since kids hate that you are better than them and report you like crazy I got a x7 kill on shipment when i was doing my mounted challenge for a gun and i got shadow banned for it In other words this game is trash and the only reason i still play it is because of the adrenaline hype and lack of other things to do Stay away from this game at all costs and the next cod that comes out better be of better quality when it comes to its anti cheat and shadowbans",neg

1938090,"As a kid I was a CoD enjoyer too much even CoD 4 was my favorite game despite its major flaws necessity of stopping power juggernaut iron lungs martyrdom last stand etc I stayed with the series until Black Ops 2 really MW3 where it was just too frustrating to play and I no longer enjoyed it I switched over to PC and started playing CSGO and absolutely loved it although that soft spot for CoD persisted

I fully came back to the series for WWII as the annoying jetpack style was gone Prop hunt was great but the game wasnt Then I got Black Ops 4 to play with friends That didnt last long the hero style shooters fell off for me after Overwatch poisoned the well The first Modern Warfare remake comes out play it like it but it doesnt last because I didnt like most of the maps or Warzone janky Pubg was the only fun BR for me Bought Cold War because the Beta was fun literal waste of money as all the actual fun I got out of it was in the free Beta Bought Vanguard not fun Then the hype starts building for a MW2 remake and it looks good

Part of what made me really interested in MW2 2022 was that there wasnt going to be a CoD coming the year after So this game was going to live for 2 years without completely dying as the next installment comes out Dope SIKE We all know another CoD is coming Nov 2023 Now all of what we got for MW2 at launch comes under scrutiny The game was buggy and broken Parties wouldnt even work joining games as a party was a crap shoot on who would make it No map voting Not a lot of maps despite looking like a decent map list most of them are restricted to certain modes If you were to compare this to the OG MW2 it shipped with 16 where the modern installment that has the benefit of 13 years of CoD to rely on had 10 Very few calling cardsemblems or at least a complete lack of UI describing those lists The UI was atrocious for finding anything and it lagged constantly Using a 3090 so its not on my end The in game UI for editing a class is dumbeddown so it doesnt give information for your changes which huge win there for editing classes mid match although god forbid we learn how to load camos in that same UI With the menu lag trying to switch a camo in between games could be impossible Too little downtime between games The unlock tree was explained extremely poorly and forces you to play with gunsattachments you dont want to use The game felt unfinished largely unfinished in terms of polish you would expect from a AAA multi billion dollar franchise At first it was fine Theyll fix it we all decried The community saw this as a labor of love especially with no CoD coming in 2023 they had plenty of time to iron out their deficiencies Over time theyve tweaked some things and added as few maps as humanly possible while continuing to not fix major UX issues

I dont want to have to restart my game every time theres an update The shitty DRM should be able to validate my update without having to completely restart thats bad UX I dont want to have to rebuild the shader cache if the update had nothing to do with texturesshaders I love seeing that cache building and just stuck at 2 for 15 minutes then jumps to 90 great visual feedback When I launch the game I want to play it if hoops are placed in front of me Im already done playing the game I shouldnt need Warzone installed I dont want a bunch of pointless updates to download that are Warzone specific when Ive never played WZ2 Make WZ a standalone game thats free and leave the actual game intact The game takes up way too much space for assets and aspects of the game I dont want Even MW 2019 on the awful Blizzard launcher had installation options They probably never added it because they couldnt even release WZ at launch Then what really chaps my cheeks is you had classic maps at launch but were part of the WZ map or maps for the big team modes You couldnt slice it and give us a piece

The game released at 70 mind you without any classic maps No Rust Terminal Highrise Estate Afghan Favela etc Nor DLC maps that were fan favorites Yet Shipment comes back so the community get placated with camo grinds that only lasts so long MW2 2022 should have launched with almost complete feature parity from the 2009 version How can we get UI right over 12 years prior just to make it practically unusable today Theres so much wasted and dead space throughout the UI yet its completely cluttered in other spots The storefront obviously gets the most love Why couldnt it at least release with MW 2019 maps In my honest opinion most of those were trash too but Id still say options are options Have 40 maps and allow people to vote on the next map If they dont want people voting on the same map over and over try adding more maps instead of removing a beloved feature Its like Battlefield 2042 removing info from the scoreboard stop letting those with bad ideas run these billion dollar IPs into the ground Having the lobby practically disband after every match is a terrible experience for anyone who played prior to like 2016 But if we dont soft reset the lobby how will our SBMM determine who youre going to lose to next game

SBMM is something a lot of people complained about it really does hurt having casual fun but where I see it as a complete failure is in groups Some guys I play with are not great at FPS I play a lot of FPS people who are a fair match against me will completely shit on my friends Is that fair or fun No not for them Then they dont want to play after 23 matches of turbo sweats trying to match my energy If you want SBMM put it in a ranked playlist oh wait they didnt have that for months after the games launch Then you get all the ways to spoof the system kill yourself a bunch of times leave games throw games use a goofy loadout to intentionally downgrade your performance index sit afk with a joystick forced one way or a weight on your keys This is not a formula that begets a fun gameplay experience for most users How many times have you played an objective based game mode and 45 of your teammates are allergic to the objective The answer is countless whether you realize it or not

I like using the drill charge but hate getting killed by it a classic conundrum The drill mechanic is probably one of the reasons importing old maps could pose a challenge I enjoyed most of the guns at least before people really started figuring out the ultimate dickhead combinations I like the mic on after killing someonegetting killed Thats such a great addition and I know its not new to this game Aside from being called racial expletives but hey thats gaming I despise what they are doing with skins as I get older I find it harder to discern player from environment especially with graphics getting better that means camo actually works A lot of terrible skins have been added to this and previous CoDs that completely break visual homology Mother fucking Saw slides and jumps around a corner to kill me and it just looks so stupid Its as if Im playing on a custom server that has Master Chief speed hacking with a trail of hearts while his gun shoots dildos Its ridiculous Then if it isnt some ridiculous character its a MessiKDNeymar calling me fggot or just some completely blacked out skin hiding in the shadows Its like an even worse version of what fortnite does because skins can provide a legitimate advantage if you dont turn your brightness up to washed out levels 

I get the sense that those who make these games dont play them or have never played them therefore they will continue to make poor decisions that benefit the business more than the player Vote with your wallet dont buy this game or any that come after it

230410,"Ive been playing Warframe since Gauss update which is around 2019 or so Awesome fast paced looter shooter game

I dont usually play third person shooter games with photorealistic design like these but this one is an exception The Warframe designs which are like bio mechas are amazing the gameplay is really fun and its not just about the guns it also have melees and warframes abilities which combines into unique builds You can also change your warframes functionalities like strength durations and range with mods and such The cinematic stories are phenomenal and I still praise them till this day The game also has a lot of game modes which we will also come to this later The game also has amazingly friendly comunity as well This game is FREE TO PLAY while having AAA game level of designs and you can grind premium currency ingame pretty easily

HOWEVER the game is quite grindy which is the least worst thing on the list
You want to play with new stuffs NOW but you have to wait 3 days for it to finish crafting which kills off the hype
Every content updates brings you new game modes which is another content island that has barely anything to do with the rest of the game with materials that once you have everything you can craft with that materials will with no doubt never want to have anything to do with that game mode ever again Although a lot of content updates adds a lot of refreshing new game modes and well contents they all feel so different that it feels like another game entirely Every time
The game also lacks a form of endgame content By that I dont mean sitting in Survival for 2 hours killing level 9999 foot soldiers By that I mean actual hard bosses Assassinate missions are a joke the bosses are forgettable save for Eidolons Orbs and Ropalolyst which are not available for majority of the player unless they grind really hard to unlock them not to mention actually be able to beat them Railjacks are fun for the first hour or so but its also another content island which you dont want to have anything to do with Asides from those Liches and Sisters hunts are actually quite fun challenging and memorable as a boss and does give some nice uses or Raijacks as their dramatic final confrontation The new Orowyrm in Duviri Paradox is also quite something too but wayy too easy
I stopped playing Warframe around The New War but its still fun enough to keep me coming back to the game occasionally because of the fun gameplay the mechanics deep under it keeps pushing me away and every updates with new game modes keep getting me dumbfounded of what is going on and what to do every time I return

TLDR very fun game with fun gameplay but once you look deeper you will see a mess behind the mechanics",pos

230410,"There are so many great games out there Games with well written plot characters thoroughly crafted world and fun engaging gameplay but noooo Ive chosen to play this game for 13k hours Dont make my mistakes  play something else




What you wanna see some explanation as to why Im not recommending this 
strikepiece of cake
strike game Alright Ill do my best to explain but first a tiny note if you are already playing Warframe and enjoying it  great keep playing 

At a first glance Warframe seemed to be fairly good and engaging game visually it looks fine gameplay is fastpaced and overall fun to play Huge solar map and seeming existence of story creates an illusion of a deep well made game But that doesnt last long and as soon as you dive deep into the game it reveals what it really all about repetitive boring meaningless grind spiced up with endless bugs lack of structure logic and creativity
Warframe has actually very little content to offer and whatever content is there is just shoved into players face with absolutely no explanation or guidance or preparation
With the exception of a few storymissions and Plains of Eidolon all locations are just a random pile of premade tiles glued together during loading Tiles are rooms and there are maybe a few dozens of them in each set As a consequence missions look alike on different planets to the point when its impossible to differentiate one from another Considering that there are over 200 missions and only four main tilesets one for every enemy faction with tiny variations for onplanet and inspace missions soon I got sick of seeing same surroundings again and again
Game modes cant boast of variety either there are basically again four of them  a few modifiers Um correction that is on paper there are fourchange in reality youd be hard pressed to find difference between them as they feel and play rather identical 
Adding insult to injury AI is extremely simplistic making enemies blindly run at the player in sometimes straight line Cloak and they would act like nothing happened and no tenno was there Its little to no fun or excitement dealing this such opponents Often I felt sorry for them however odd that sounds
Now imagine all mentioned above multiplied by hundred or thousand Sounds tempting isnt it Once all quests are completed and all planets are explored there is not much left to do either further level up your Mastery Rank or customize your warframe playable character and equipment to its max Leveling Mastery Rank up is simple level up gear such as weapons companions or warframes Process of acquiring an item and then leveling it up is mindlessly simple and requires player to do samesimilar mission over and over and over again until the goal is reached Some stuff can be bought for real money but process of leveling it up cant be skipped
And finally icing on this cake bugs Endless bugs Every new bigor small update brings bugs often game breaking A recent example Sanctuary Onslaught game essentially was crashing when host player disconnected  host migration was not working on release and devs fixed this issue almost a week later What QA team was doing before the release remains a mystery Assuming there is a quality assurance team employed at DE devs

At the end of the day Warframe can offer very simple stylish gameplay with no depth to it If you are looking for more than that this game would feels just as fun as grinding wooden blocks with a sandpaper  for short sessions andor with friends to keep distracted   an okay experience but playing it solo for a prolonged duration of time at once is just dreadful

PS My experience is based on playing with Prime Access which costs like new AAA game and cuts in half leveling and credits grind plus gives platinum and credits Cant imagine what its like to play the f2pway the first time around

PPS and I havent even touched atrocious boss fights forsaken Index and Archwing modes unbalanced rewards absolutely annoying radio transmissions amateur voice acting glitching matchmaking convenient trading with other players lack of creativity or imagination when it comes to new stuff confusing craftingmods etc There are a lot of things wrong and no hint on something getting right anytime soon  only more new stuff added making game more and more chaotic

credits  ingame free currency
platinum or plat  premium currency",neg

230410,"Edit 7182020 Politics has infected everything  DE is in bed with Communist Enjoy helping China intern their own minorities while placating those who would take away your ability to make the very game you have spent your lives creating  

Warframe There was a point in my time with World of Warcraft that I just became bored the fantasy asthetic I yearned for  the scifi for space I took a chance and played Mass Effect long after it had been out and was gobsmacked How could I have missed this game I thought  It strached that itched But it was not enough I needed more I looked and looked until I found Totalbiscuts lets play of Warframe And that was it I had found my game 

For a free to play game it has one of the most fair models there is If you have the time play If you dont pay The point of game is to play It is your choice to use fauxmoney to by the ingame currency Orrrrrrrr you can just play the game 
And if you are of a mind to try to have some fun while you do it

Pros
Support and engagement It would be hard pressed to say that they people that develope Warframe Digital Extreme lack any passion for this game They are almost fanatical about it Which in and of itself is a pro and a con You forget where you started see only the bright future and very rarely fill in the cracks that develop along the way 

I may have put too much into the idea that a developer would truly heed the calls by the player base In the end they have to keep the lights on And while that must be put first without an ear to the people that are paying to keep the lights on a developer may find the dog didnt just bite but took the whole forearm off at the elbow  

Game play a nice blend of beatem up and shooter in 3rd person perspective I like to see myself in relationship to world around me 

Cons

Loot system I am a big advocate of diablo style loot systems Warframe could hands down benefit from this style system with a revamped crafting system 

Parthian sTHOughT
The push for end game lt was in this game that learned that end game is what people look for when they want a reason to stop playing a game That is really what endgame is It is our push to escape the gravity of something that we have invested such a large amount of time in that we want that period at the end of the sentance The high note the touchdown grand slam the buzzer beater  

Well what if the game had no end What if we just played How about we have more game 

More game less endgame",neg
230410,"If I were to describe this game in one word it would be Repetitive

Devs for some reason decided a while ago to start removing anything that was fun and not grindy so no I cant recommend this game to anyone
There are a ton of max lvl players or lvl 18 who sit around doing nothing no matter what and the chat made for playing with other people always hosts negative or players who have no interest in new players no matter what

If you love grinding no dont get this game because unless youre interested in using tricks or bugs to solo any of the endless modes you wont be doing anything past quick endless missions and thats the same as wasting a so called key for the higher maps though you can also play the normal maps for no real loot besides resources that youll be using for crafting weapons and such 
There are of course other things to do like spend hours upon hours of grinding for rare items to sell for premium currency so you can join the fashionframe spending all your money on cosmetics so you can look cool like everyone else

Is there anything redeeming Not anymore no anything that has been added has been kicked down into the dirt due to DE also known as the devs of this game for some reason thinking it was either overpowered too easy or a third reason which makes even less sense

AFK Farming Impliment a broken AFK timer that completely nullifies any and all regen on your character until you press your dodge key

A certain build requires very specific attributes to work but it makes you invincible and isnt fun to use all the time Dont worry DEs got you covered completely change the characters abilities and attribute bonuses thatll make everyone happy right

An ability can be upgraded to pull mob drops to you but still makes you build in a very specific way Make the upgrade only affect the user surely thatl lbe a good change no one will dislike it

Im making it sound like it only affected characters but even the weapons in the game suffer and they suffer way too hard than you can possibly think some weapons are just so insanely overpowered some for a while some have kept their spot for years only beaten by newer versions of that weapon and with this some weapons are instantly thrown out of the window when some weapons hit the community even with upgraded versions of the weapon the old ones are most likely thrown out on the spot

Sure you can use any weapon you like no one has the right to tell you to not use something just because another weapon is better but if you arent doing the damage you need to and you want to play a tiny bit serious youll have to follow everyone else using the strong weapons and say goodbye to your cool or less popular weapons no exceptions 

The list goes on to things that make even less sense and even things that didnt make anything easy or stupid were changed because of DEs stupidity
Its surprising this game isnt dead already if you were here from the start and still play I feel very sorry for you


Edit I forgot to mention another big thing that completely ruined the game when I was talking about builds multiple characters or frames  warframes have been completely changed in how stats affect their abilities meaning if you had a build from long ago that needed one set of mods theres a big chance all those hours and items spent on getting the perfect build together will be completely wasted and youll more or less have to do it all over Never any compensation or at least a warning Im over 100 sure Im not the only one that had to reforma a few frames or discard it completely because of it Sure some playstyles or builds will always be good at one point and fall off or become much less effective at some point but this was almost completely opposite of what you normally would use on certain characters before Then theres the problem with mod points either pay 20 premium currency for double mod points to upgrade your character with or save it for the prime version of the warframe which will come but might first come far in the future leaving people with less time and money hanging around with characters unsuited for missions behind because theyre saving that upgrade for the prime version Who by the way will always have some type of upgrade either better or easier ways of modding correctly or having better survivability",neg

There are a lot of sus shots that happen and in some cases your opponent does have scripts or devices but that is typical for a game priced at 15 And more recently with the introduction of FaceIT Anti Cheat the privacy of players in general is put into question Its cool to introduce it for good faith reasons but the devs could have found more better solutions like AI Anti Cheat that can detect even the smallest movement without screenshots made by FaceIT with 90 or more accuracy

671860,I cant fucking seeI am bad,neg
671860,I HAVE A GLITCH WHERE ENIMIES KEEP ON SHOOTING MY HEAD WHEN IM IN COVER OR FAR AWAY AND SOMEHOW WHEN I SHOOT SOMEONE I DIE FIRST AND SOMEHOW THESES ANOTHER GLITCH WHERE MY TEAMATES DONT REVIVE ME,neg
671860,people lay prone in grass and wait for you to walk past smgs are snipers,neg
671860,I think its fun for a bit but the community only plays the same 4 maps Still in early access so Im hoping that in the future theyll work on sound design,neg
671860,no,neg
671860,Needs a maybe button Yes and No Fun game that keeps you invested in playing longer to improve your weaponry Many problems though Biggest problem is the game offers a spectate camera that lets you see everything Yes everything You can see the enemy and your team You can make callouts for your teammates and tell them exactly where a person is hiding You can spectate individual players and share screen to give them ESP This is built in by the game itself and is available to everyone Not a good thing IMO Not only are there actual cheaters in the game but this makes everyone capable Then you have limited heavy weaponry and crew craftshelis 1 tank 1 btr 2 helis maybe for 127 people Then people squad up and lock out the heli so nobody else gets to use it and boot people from squads that arent their friends Basically you never get to use the things and when you do someone spawns on you and starts into the 10 year old git gud routine because you dont know how to operate the machine that you NEVER use Its frankly toxic and leaves a sour taste when thinking of the game Maybe its having to run the 700m back from the nearest spawn point because there is no other spawns only to be instatapped on the way Then there is the combat Either desync or just bad mechanics happens far too often Run through a door the same time as an enemy and you die before you even hear a shot Get sniped through trees and rocks while running by a sniper 10000m across the map Get into a fire fight and land 10 shots using an M249 but never kill the guy meanwhile he flicks on you and insta taps you with a pistol The submachine guns while nice are OP and need major nerfs compared to how bad the heavy caliber guns perform in relation to fire rate and damage Sniping is a joke with the glint constantly shining making YOU the target and there is NO optional way to hidecoverremove the glint effect so if you use a scope you are screwed I have vision issues so scopes are helpful to see but giving myself away just to see is a joke Then there is the LEADER class that you NEVER get to play Honestly why have it when only 1 person can be it Not that it is special but it goes back to the heli issue where you never get the chance These are just a few of the issues I have encountered but certainly not the least The game has its ups and downs and certainly has potential to be one of the best combat games of the year but with all the small details that just eat at me its hard to really give it the thumbs up,neg
671860,"I didnt feel the love for this game  Its less chaotic than BF2042 which I like  Theres greater focus on infantry combat and not using a wing suit to 360 quackscoop me midair with huge player counts but without teamlevel and squadlevel coordination its like watching roaches in a trailer  Everyone is scattered about and the VOIP is very underutilized  Some starting weapons are weak enough to be worthless  Players ignore orders Squads are either all recon or all engineer  Important classes are ignored further making teamwork not a factor  Hit flinching is far too strong  Its easy to be out of the fight after a bullet grazes your ankle because your aim is now 40 degrees to the right and theres no time to correct with the quick time to kill

Positives would be
Cheaper than BF unless you have a subscription already
Middle finger to a AAA developer that cant do it right
Still a playable silly game but I cant say it plays better than BF2042 anymore  Dice has patched up a lot of issues
Easy on your storage
127vs127 player battles are a great technological achievement
Game runs great and can probably be played on just about any modern computer even with Intel integrated graphics
If you dont already have a modern Battlefield game this is an affordable alternative that is not even finished yet
Player counts are about 3times higher than BF2042 here in early access  BattleBit will be great for the FPS industry and to show DICE what works better",neg
671860,I dont recommend this game All the fun looking items require over 8 hours of grinding and so far its just the same of walking shooting and occasionally driving a vehicle The weapons dont feel very different from one another and there isnt a lot of room for creativity in the gameplay Maybe this changes once unlocking more stuff but if it feels like such a slog to get there its not really justified Unlocks should be 4x faster and you should get some xp for finishing a game and some extra for winning Also the discrepancy between new players and people with all the unlocks is ridiculous it wouldnt be so bad if it didnt take so long to feel like your on the same playing field as everyone else,neg
671860,POLYGON is better,neg
671860,"unfair gunplay annoying reload magazine mechanic dying from every single side as soon as you spawn running takes ages to get to the objective bad healing system and also overpowered weapons like the vector

This game has its positives though never dropped a frame while playing servers run incredibly well without any pinglag supporting up to 250 players which is cool graphics are fine for what they are and maps are pretty good

It would be great for the game to have normal reload and magazine mechanics like other shooters for example being like this 30240 bullets in mag instead of guessing how many you have left by the small image and instinctively reloading only for the soldier to drop the magazine with bullets still left inside This game tried going for realism with this system but failed at it as if you look at it from a side perspective you are in unturned mixed with battlefield

The game feels tedious to play rather than fun you get killed instantly the milisecond the enemy spots you and you spot him the healing is very janky in my opinion as you can only stop bleeding and not heal up correctly There is a cool mechanic that you can drag allies behind cover to revive them and medics actually do their job most of the time

510 great potential bad execution",neg
