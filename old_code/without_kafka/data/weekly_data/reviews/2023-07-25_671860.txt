This is the best first person shooter games I have played after battlefield 4. This might look like battlefield but it is actually not. It has far more mechanics to it's game play which is far superior to any battlefield game ever made.\n\nThis is not run and gun like the last 10 years battlefield games so be warned. The game play is way hardcore and weapons are harder to control than in battlefield games. The sound design is not bad but it is no where near battlefield level and it does not have the immersion of being in the real battlefield.\n\nDo not buy this if want to replace your current battlefield game with this game. \n\nThis a totally different game and it is much better than any other battlefield games I have ever played. This is just the beginning and if they keep this up it will become a legendary game in the future. \n\nThis game will run even in potato PC so no worries. Just buy the game because this is an amazing game and stop giving money to the greedy AAA publishers who can't even make a game which is 10% as good as battlebit.      True
                   I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for his birthday from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my class and started playing. but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he had me join his game. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories      True

Too slow to reload. 99% of the time no idea where your getting shot from. No kill cam to see who shot you. Too realistic for a game that looks fake. Can't revive without dying, cant revive without them dying within a second. When you find cover it seems you get killed regardless.\n\nIt's a really fun game, it can be a fun game, but starting too hard for a beginner player is ridiculous. I don't want to spend 30 years just to get good at a game. People say "get better" but why invest into a game where I try hard just to throw my keyboard across the room.

No hardcore mode, just suffer until you unlock a gun worth using. Sniper rifles shine at a distance!? Is there anything this game doesn't steel from better games and do worse?
