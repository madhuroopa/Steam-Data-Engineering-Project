Week 5 Recap Here's what's happening, and what you should expect from BattleBit in the near future: Community Servers! Our primary focus this month is to work on bringing community servers into the mix and creating API access for server admins. This will allow them to customize server settings to their preference. Here's what you can expect from community servers (should server admins choose to host one): Sniper-only servers Pistol-only servers More competitive, hardcore servers More arcade-style, less milsim servers Flight school servers Ace Of Spades-style voxel servers (Yes, we have this feature! It's currently not public and is reserved for community servers.) Clan servers Other servers according to admin's preferences... New Game Mode Implementations - Revisiting Existing Game Modes Our old school, one of our favorite gamemode, Capture The Flag!. We're experimenting with how this mode will work with 254 players, and it will also be playable on 64vs64 and 32vs32 scales. We plan to make additional enhancements to Frontline as we are not completely satisfied with its current state of development. After Capture the Flag, we plan to experiment with the King Of The Hill game mode in future updates. Reworking and Introducing New Maps We've completely remade MultuIslands from the ground up. Brand new maps and more reworks are no the way! https://youtu.be/ijtO3HsatGI v1.9.3 Patch Notes New Game Mode: Capture The Flag! New Map: MultuIslands Capture the flag, if flag is carried over to any safe zone, main base etc, it will be auto teleported back to flag's spawn point to prevent someone keeping flag in safe zone. UI improvements for Capture The Flag The spectator mode has been further improved. Player lag has been improved during rope climbing. The issue where turrets, helicopters, etc. were incorrectly counted as 'shots fired' in stats has been fixed. Spawning on players will not be rewarded until the game starts. Tanks will no longer apply torque when the wheels are not touching the ground. Bullets will only passthrough 50% damage when shot through vehicle windows. Salhan - Southern area city buildings were replaced with more durable ones that will block line of sight from A even after destroying it. Salhan and Frugis objectives adjustments based on players feedback to avoid spawn camping Valley - DOMI 16v16 layout tweaked. Eduardovo - DOMI 16v16 layout tweaked. Namak - roof exploit fixed. incorrect naming of \"Support Armor 00 A Big\" fixed The game has been updated to version 1.9.3 July 23th, 2023 Stay up-to-date and in touch with us on Discord and Twitter.

It's been a month since Early Access launch and we'd love to hear from you! In this week's update, we've made some changes to the size of objective capture areas to provider a tighter and more consistent attack - defend dynamic. In some cases, capture areas were too large as a result of a discrepancy between the dev environment and the in-game result. We're also making it easier to party up with users not on your friends list, and added a quicker way to report users without using the scoreboard. Additional fail-safes have been implemented to protect users from progress loss or stat resets. Our next major update is set to bring a reworked map and a fan favorite game mode, but for now, read along for the full patch notes for 1.8.1. Patch Notes Party Codes: New feature that enables players to join parties without adding each other as Steam Friends Report Player Shortcut: Left Shift + F1/2/3/4, etc will bring up the report menu for the respective player, without having to go to the scoreboard. This makes it easier to report players for abusive behavior, or other inappropriate conduct Stat-Sync Protection: A rare case has been fixed where a player's progress would reset if they joined a game server while the player stats servers were being updated. This happened because the game server would receive the player's stats as level 0, which would reset the player's progress. To fix this, the game server will now no longer let a player join if it fails to fetch their stats. This will prevent players from joining the server with level 0. Additionally, the backend will no longer accept saving stats of a player if their rank is less than it was before. This will help to prevent players from unintentionally resetting their progress. Objective Capture Zones: Sizes have been reduced to 50%/75% of their original size in some areas. This should improve the user experience in CONQ and FRONTLINE game modes, as it will make it easier to defend objectives and allow your team to spawn on them until the enemy enters the capture zone and triggers the spawn lock. This change will also make it more difficult to hide in one of the many buildings on the map and stay in the enemy objective in order to disable their spawn. Placed Gadget Persistence: Players will now be limited in the amount of C4s, mines, claymores, ammo kits, etc. that they can place at the same time. C4s will be destroyed when a player dies. A maximum of 6 can be placed. If a player tries to place a 7th C4, the first one will be destroyed to maintain a total of 6. Claymores and mines will not be destroyed when a player dies. However, only 4 can be placed at a time. If a player tries to place a 5th claymore or mine, the first one will be destroyed to ensure that there are only 4 at a time. Domination - Reviving players will no longer return tickets. Eduardovo - CONQ 32v32 received a unique layout that is separate from the 127v127 playable area. Salhan - RU Border has been extended on the west side (Cav exit) to make spawn camping more difficult. Frugis - The last stage of Rush received changes allowing the attacking team to exit from a subway near the enemy spawn. Wakistan - Domination 32v32 layout will now feature an east coast line layout. The old layout will be moved to 16v16 The number of players in enemy vehicles will no longer be shown on the map when they are spotted. When placing walls, there will be a half-player-size space margin requirement to avoid clipping. This means that there must be at least half the size of a player between the wall and any other object, such as another wall or a player. This is to prevent the wall from clipping through other objects, which can cause visual and gameplay issues. Fixed an issue where players would not switch to their primary weapon when placing a claymore while throwing a grenade Fixed an issue where the friend list would not load until the party menu was hovered over Fixed an issue where players were unable to pass the main menu due to avatar images Fixed the broken Progress Bar at the bottom of the screen A bug where players could sometimes walk during the countdown on Frontline has been fixed. Fixed an issue causing players to lag while using the Rappelling Rope Spectator camera improved.
