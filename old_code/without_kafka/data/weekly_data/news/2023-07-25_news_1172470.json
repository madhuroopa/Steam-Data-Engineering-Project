                "contents": "NEW UPDATES COMING WITH APEX LEGENDS\u2122: RESURRECTION Death lurks around every corner in the Apex Games, but now is the time for Resurrection. Revenant has been rejuvenated with a new look, new abilities, and a new level of rage. Not unlocked? No problem. Play as Revenant all season long, and unlock him permanently by completing challenges. There\u2019s something for everyone this season\u2014from Broken Moon in Mixtape, a revamped Charge Rifle, updates to Ranked, new community Stickers from ryonello, and the new Death Dynasty Collection Event\u2014and it all starts August 8, 2023. Stay tuned for our full list of updates in our Resurrection Patch Notes coming this Monday, August 7, 2023. LEGEND UPDATE: REVENANT https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/resurrection-season-game-updates/resurrection-season-game-updates-revenant-heirloom.jpg.adapt.1024w.jpg For years, Revenant has been mired in feelings of rage, self-hatred, and a lack of autonomy. He spent almost 300 years under the Syndicate\u2019s thumb with the help of Hammond, and all he wanted was to escape it. Suddenly, Revenant experiences a change\u2014he starts to glitch. Everything is out of his control. In the middle of a match, he loses his abilities only to discover they've been replaced with new ones. Someone, somewhere, has launched a new protocol. He finds that he\u2019s able to see enemies low on health, unleash a powerful leap forward, and forge a shroud of shadows around him that blocks incoming damage. But he also knows how to hold a grudge. Revenant\u2019s angry, confused, and now he'll find and get revenge on whoever is messing with him. PASSIVE: Assassin\u2019s Instinct Highlight nearby visible enemies who are low on health. You crouch walk faster and have improved wall climbing. TACTICAL: Shadow Pounce Unleash a powerful pounce forwards. Hold to charge for farther distances. ULTIMATE: Forged Shadows Forge a shroud of hardened shadows around you that blocks direct damage and regenerates after breaking. Your shadows and tactical are refreshed on knockdowns. Revenant will be unlocked for all players, all-season long. Players can complete challenges by using Revenant throughout the season in order to unlock him permanently. CHARGE RIFLE UPDATE The Charge Rifle has been re-designed for immediate use in the Apex Games. No longer does the infamous weapon fire a sustained beam. Newly fitted with an Extended Sniper Mag attachment slot and boasting a number of changes to its firing mechanisms, Legends familiar with the anti-Titan model available during the Frontier Wars should feel right at home. Holding the trigger down will increase the weapon\u2019s charge, while releasing the trigger will decrease it. Once fully charged, a powerful energy projectile is released which deals increased damage the further it travels. This projectile can pierce through multiple enemy Legends, so watch out which teammates you cozy up to! MIXTAPE: BROKEN MOON NEW TDM & GUN RUN MAP: THE CORE https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/resurrection-season-game-updates/resurrection-season-game-updates-core.jpg.adapt.1024w.jpg Broken Moon is coming to Mixtape! The Core provides a new and exciting battlefield for Gun Run and TDM. Occupying the central building gives great high ground and wide-open sightlines making it a prime location to fight over. Or take to the outer ring for prime access to Care Packages. The Core is a little bit bigger than what we\u2019ve played previously. Zip rails help players rotate towards the action quickly and open sightlines promote a different style of gameplay and weapon meta than the other more personal, scrappier maps. NEW CONTROL MAP: PRODUCTION YARD https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/resurrection-season-game-updates/resurrection-season-game-updates-production-yard.jpg.adapt.1024w.jpg It\u2019s been a while since our last Control map and Broken Moon brings Production Yard to Control. Contrary to our other Broken Moon map for Mixtape, Production Yard provides an intense, scrappy experience in tight quarters. Lots of boxes and cover to duck around and tight corners to set-up defense or ambushes. Also featuring Broken Moon\u2019s Zip rails, combat pace is really high on this map and allows players to quickly shift from attacking and defending at a moment's notice. We\u2019re hoping players find a lot of different strategies in either bunkering up and covering angles or finding some sneaky back caps using zip rails and corners. RANKED UPDATE We\u2019ve tightened up the matchmaking, tuned LP gains, and made eliminations a steady contributor to your rise through the ranks. Dive into the nitty-gritty of why Resurrection will see some of the sweatiest matches you\u2019ve had this summer (or winter) in our recent Ranked Update blog. RANKED REWARD REWORK In previous seasons, players achieving Diamond+ ranks would get access to an exclusive season-long Dive Trail. We\u2019ve been observing an unintended effect where the presence of a Ranked Dive Trail during the drop would unduly influence where players wanted to land\u2014either strongly avoiding or actively pursuing players with the trail. A reward for being a top player shouldn\u2019t give away valuable information at a critical part of the match, so we\u2019ve made a change to swap the Dive Trail reward with an Epic Banner Frame as the Diamond+ Ranked reward. The Epic Banner Frame lets players flex their hard-earned status at the start of a match and more importantly, every time they take down other players. Badges, Holosprays and Weapon Cosmetics will continue to be rewarded in Ranked as in previous seasons. COMMUNITY STICKER BUNDLE https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/resurrection-season-game-updates/resurrection-season-game-updates-community-sticker-bundle.jpg.adapt.1024w.jpg You love seeing Apex Legends\u2122 fan art and so does the team, so we had to have even more enter the game. From August 8-22, pick up our latest community sticker bundle featuring a plethora of stickers (and some special holographic ones) created by ryonello! \u201cI had a lot of fun with it and got to explore sort of the more cheeky smug mischievous like unhinged side of the characters.\u201d \u201cMy message to aspiring artists with the community is keep going, I love you. Draw what you love and other people will love it too. And I would really love to see your work as part of the collaborations one day.\u201d Learn more about how stickers work in our FAQ here. DEATH DYNASTY COLLECTION EVENT https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/resurrection-season-game-updates/resurrection-season-game-updates-collection-event.jpg.adapt.1024w.jpg Death becomes you, Legends. Our first event of Resurrection will be launching with the season, and you\u2019ll be handsomely rewarded with double XP in Battle Royale from August 8-15 and then in Mixtape from August 15-22. COLLECTION EVENT ITEMS Capture 24 limited-time cosmetics before they expire, with Legendary skins for Catalyst, Loba, and more! All 24 items will be available in exchange for Apex Coins or Crafting Metals and in Death Dynasty Event Apex Packs for the entire duration of the event. You\u2019ll automatically receive Revenant\u2019s Death Grip Heirloom set once you\u2019ve secured all 24 items for your eternal collection. REWARD TRACKER Earn up to 1,600 points per day, challenges refresh daily and all challenges will stack with your Battle Pass so you can complete multiple challenges at once.
