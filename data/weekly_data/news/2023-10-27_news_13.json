Apex Legends is getting cross progression. As soon as the season starts, Apex Legends players with multiple accounts spread across PC and consoles will have their accounts merged into one master account. Your highest rank across your accounts will carry over, as will all your cosmetics which will be compiled into one neat collection. We're not quite sure yet how duplicate cosmetics will work, but fingers crossed that you get a nice amount of in-game currency. This is obviously great news for longtime players, especially those who may have a stray legendary skin lost on an old console (<a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-switch-trailer.\">or even the dreaded Apex Legends Switch version</a>) that they've been leaving to gather dust for a while now.

As always, it's a nice little animated trailer giving us some insight into how Conduit found her way to the Apex Games. The trailer kicks off with quite a bleak look at Conduit's childhood, showing us that her hometown was under attack from a group of enemy titans. Thankfully, a Monarch titan comes to the rescue, letting her and her family live quite an idyllic life, and of course Conduit is quite the fan of the Apex Games. Unfortunately, her mother still seems to have a difficult workload, eventually netting herself a serious injury which leads them to some financial trouble. Lucky for Conduit, that same Monarch titan stayed in her town, though it has been cordoned off due to it leaking radiated energy. Obviously that doesn't stop her, and she goes to find the titan where she gets\u2026 some kind of power, it hasn't actually been revealed yet. In turn, she'll clearly be joining the Apex Games soon as part of the game's next season, <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/ignite\">Ignite</a>. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-newest-character-reveal-will-put-those-titanfall-3-rumours-to-bed\">Read more</a> ",
