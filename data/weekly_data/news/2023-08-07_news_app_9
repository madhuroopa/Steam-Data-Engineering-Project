Our latest update brings a wealth of changes to improve your time in BattleBit Remastered. While some may seem overdue, it was very important to us that we take our time with aspects that may alter the core gameplay. We poured over all of your feedback constantly, to provide what we hope you will find as healthy additions to the game. In short, you can expect faster progression, an additional healing method available to all classes, TWO new map reworks and further polish/bug fixes. We've also made major progress with our Community Server API and will expand our testing as we lead up to a larger rollout of access. v2.0.0 Patch Notes GENERAL PLAYER UI / UX Game will no longer auto lock squads when a party member reserves a squad for their party to join, instead, a non party member will be forced change squad (with their role) if the reserved party squad is full while a party member is joining to server. Improved detection for targeting downed players to bandage/revive. A bug where player's armors & body does not sync when player is standing still and client loads their object for first time until they move - fixed. When a player shoots at a mine/C4/claymore, the shooter will take ownership for the explosion, as if they owned the mine/C4/claymore. Previously, ownership remained with the person who deployed the mine, even when someone else shot at it. This led to instances where shooting a friend's claymore/mine would kill them. Players will no longer be allowed to place mine/claymore under water PROGRESSION/XP IMPROVEMENTS Progression curve will ease after level 15 to keep consistent time to level up. - This is intended to decrease the time commitment and XP required to reach level 200 on average. Empty transport/boat vehicles will no longer give points when destroyed. XP Score Event added: Destroying enemy c4/mine/claymore will give a hitmarker and additional XP CLANS Clan submissions will open with requirements of minimum Prestige 1. Used clan invites persisting once used from clan invite list has been fixed. The issue where the 100 clan invite limitation included expired invites has been fixed. UNIVERSAL HEALING After a long discussion, it's apparent that the medic is the only class capable of enduring more than one fight. Other classes cannot survive a second fight after being shot. Consequently, making other classes very unpleasant to use, in response, the following change has been implemented: Bandages now apply self-heal, even when bleeding, gaining +40 HP for each bandage used. This applies to all classes. - You cannot heal other players by bandaging, it remains the same as before, you can only stop bleeding or revive, but it will not heal them, only the Medic can heal OTHER players with their Medkit Gadget. CLASS ADJUSTMENTS ASSAULT - Access to Ranger Armors. - Access to the Personal Defense Weapon and Designated Marksman Rifle weapon types: Honey Badger - Groza - P90 - AsVal - MK20 - M110 - MK14 - SVD. ENGINEER & SUPPORT - New barbed wires deployable available for use ENGINEER - 2.5x XP bonus for vehicle destruction. XP with Engineer Bonus Transport vehicles: 1000xp APC: 2,000xp Tank: 4,000xp Helicopter: 4,000xp Boat: 1,000xp Other Classes Transport vehicles: 400xp APC: 800xp Tank: 1,600xp Helicopter: 1,600xp Boat: 400xp WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS Weapon attachments wouldn't affect player speed - fixed. Aim punch/flinch will exponentially scale down based on damage received, instead of pistol on leg and sniper on chest having the same effect for example. Kriss Vector Damage per bullet adjusted to 22, down from 24. Damage drop-off now starts at 10 meters, down from 50. Standard/Quick magazine now holds 36 bullets, down from 40. ACR ACR aim down time buffed from 0.25 seconds to 0.21 seconds. ACR player running speed buffed from 1.01 to 1.05 x. ACR control increased from 100% to 105%. ACR damage increased from 25 to 27. AK5C AK5C damage increased from 30 to 34. AK5C vertical recoil increased from 1.4 to 1.6 AK5C horizontal recoil increased from 1.2 to 1.4 AK5C's first shot recoil reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 AK5C's reload speed increased by 12.5%. SG550 SG550's muzzle flash size reduced from 100% to 85%. VEHICLES New Sea Vehicle: RCB90 added Destroying enemy vehicles will give different XP rewards based on type Improved road kill detection Littlebird minigun's light vehicle damage increased from 2 to 4 APC receives 2x damage from the rear Tanks & APCs - Upon firing, resupply cooldown will reset to 60 seconds to avoid player supplying & firing same time. When players return to base for repair, the driver/pilot will also be healed. Exiting the vehicle is no longer neccesary, which should reduce cases of vehicle hijacking Helicopter's sensitivity will no longer be affected by FPS (it used to be more sensitive as you had less FPS, less sensitive as you have more FPS) Stutters while piloting helicopter should be improved (need to be tested) Helicopter inflicting self-damage when game lags (i.e. opening scoreboard, etc) - fixed. Player would not able to see blood screen while inside some vehicles - fixed. Turret/minigun shots does not count as 'bullets fired' in stats - fixed. MAPS District Rework integration Wine Paradise - Rework + Expansion to support CONQ 254p gamemode MultuIslands - CONQ Ultra downscaled twice until there are more options of mobility for players MultuIslands - 32v32 Rush added. New POI was added East from middle of map to make use of Rush layout. Wakistan - Objective F was shifted to the East by 222 meters with some additional ways to enter in the middle of map. TensaTown - RUSH block silo position for Defender team to avoid spawn camping of Attacker team. Namak - Potential fix of an issue causing an inability to spawn on Objective B Further GPU optimization on 3D models of map objects Salhan - removed a OP tank spot at USA side and added some of hesco walls on long line road. Salhan - Tanks removed until exploit with tanks will be fixed to not let them climb on the cliffs. Bricks not spawning when walls are destroyed - fixed. CTF Quality of Life District and Sandy Sunset now support CTF Added safe zones for teams. Moving the flag to the safe zone will no longer teleport it back to the enemy base, but will instead teleport it next to the safe zone border. When flag carrier gets killed while swimming, players cannot recapture the flag fixed. Successfully capturing the enemy flag will award more XP. Killing the enemy flag carrier will award an additional bonus. COMMUNITY SERVER API Community server API core finished. Community servers, ability to set map rotation, gamemode rotation added.

Week 5 Recap Here's what's happening, and what you should expect from BattleBit in the near future: Community Servers! Our primary focus this month is to work on bringing community servers into the mix and creating API access for server admins. This will allow them to customize server settings to their preference. Here's what you can expect from community servers (should server admins choose to host one): Sniper-only servers Pistol-only servers More competitive, hardcore servers More arcade-style, less milsim servers Flight school servers Ace Of Spades-style voxel servers (Yes, we have this feature! It's currently not public and is reserved for community servers.) Clan servers Other servers according to admin's preferences... New Game Mode Implementations - Revisiting Existing Game Modes Our old school, one of our favorite gamemode, Capture The Flag!. We're experimenting with how this mode will work with 254 players, and it will also be playable on 64vs64 and 32vs32 scales. We plan to make additional enhancements to Frontline as we are not completely satisfied with its current state of development. After Capture the Flag, we plan to experiment with the King Of The Hill game mode in future updates. Reworking and Introducing New Maps We've completely remade MultuIslands from the ground up. Brand new maps and more reworks are no the way! https://youtu.be/ijtO3HsatGI v1.9.3 Patch Notes New Game Mode: Capture The Flag! New Map: MultuIslands Capture the flag, if flag is carried over to any safe zone, main base etc, it will be auto teleported back to flag's spawn point to prevent someone keeping flag in safe zone. UI improvements for Capture The Flag The spectator mode has been further improved. Player lag has been improved during rope climbing. The issue where turrets, helicopters, etc. were incorrectly counted as 'shots fired' in stats has been fixed. Spawning on players will not be rewarded until the game starts. Tanks will no longer apply torque when the wheels are not touching the ground. Bullets will only passthrough 50% damage when shot through vehicle windows. Salhan - Southern area city buildings were replaced with more durable ones that will block line of sight from A even after destroying it. Salhan and Frugis objectives adjustments based on players feedback to avoid spawn camping Valley - DOMI 16v16 layout tweaked. Eduardovo - DOMI 16v16 layout tweaked. Namak - roof exploit fixed. incorrect naming of \"Support Armor 00 A Big\" fixed The game has been updated to version 1.9.3 July 23th, 2023 Stay up-to-date and in touch with us on Discord and Twitter.

                "contents": "The game has been updated to version 1.8.1 July 17th, 2023 {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/29416633/d157ea859cd2a85f8be7e260ed268263178273d8.png We'd like to ask that you take a few minutes to complete our Player Experience Survey. It's been a month since Early Access launch and we'd love to hear from you! In this week's update, we've made some changes to the size of objective capture areas to provider a tighter and more consistent attack - defend dynamic. In some cases, capture areas were too large as a result of a discrepancy between the dev environment and the in-game result. We're also making it easier to party up with users not on your friends list, and added a quicker way to report users without using the scoreboard. Additional fail-safes have been implemented to protect users from progress loss or stat resets. Our next major update is set to bring a reworked map and a fan favorite game mode, but for now, read along for the full patch notes for 1.8.1. Patch Notes Party Codes: New feature that enables players to join parties without adding each other as Steam Friends Report Player Shortcut: Left Shift + F1/2/3/4, etc will bring up the report menu for the respective player, without having to go to the scoreboard. This makes it easier to report players for abusive behavior, or other inappropriate conduct Stat-Sync Protection: A rare case has been fixed where a player's progress would reset if they joined a game server while the player stats servers were being updated. This happened because the game server would receive the player's stats as level 0, which would reset the player's progress. To fix this, the game server will now no longer let a player join if it fails to fetch their stats. This will prevent players from joining the server with level 0. Additionally, the backend will no longer accept saving stats of a player if their rank is less than it was before. This will help to prevent players from unintentionally resetting their progress. Objective Capture Zones: Sizes have been reduced to 50%/75% of their original size in some areas. This should improve the user experience in CONQ and FRONTLINE game modes, as it will make it easier to defend objectives and allow your team to spawn on them until the enemy enters the capture zone and triggers the spawn lock. This change will also make it more difficult to hide in one of the many buildings on the map and stay in the enemy objective in order to disable their spawn. Placed Gadget Persistence: Players will now be limited in the amount of C4s, mines, claymores, ammo kits, etc. that they can place at the same time. C4s will be destroyed when a player dies. A maximum of 6 can be placed. If a player tries to place a 7th C4, the first one will be destroyed to maintain a total of 6. Claymores and mines will not be destroyed when a player dies. However, only 4 can be placed at a time. If a player tries to place a 5th claymore or mine, the first one will be destroyed to ensure that there are only 4 at a time. Domination - Reviving players will no longer return tickets. Eduardovo - CONQ 32v32 received a unique layout that is separate from the 127v127 playable area. Salhan - RU Border has been extended on the west side (Cav exit) to make spawn camping more difficult. Frugis - The last stage of Rush received changes allowing the attacking team to exit from a subway near the enemy spawn. Wakistan - Domination 32v32 layout will now feature an east coast line layout. The old layout will be moved to 16v16 The number of players in enemy vehicles will no longer be shown on the map when they are spotted. When placing walls, there will be a half-player-size space margin requirement to avoid clipping. This means that there must be at least half the size of a player between the wall and any other object, such as another wall or a player. This is to prevent the wall from clipping through other objects, which can cause visual and gameplay issues. Fixed an issue where players would not switch to their primary weapon when placing a claymore while throwing a grenade Fixed an issue where the friend list would not load until the party menu was hovered over Fixed an issue where players were unable to pass the main menu due to avatar images Fixed the broken Progress Bar at the bottom of the screen A bug where players could sometimes walk during the countdown on Frontline has been fixed. Fixed an issue causing players to lag while using the Rappelling Rope Spectator camera improved.
