                "contents": "Valve looks to be teasing the imminent release of <strong>Counter-Strike 2</strong>, if we're reading this cheeky Tweet correctly. The game has been in limited, closed beta testing since March, when <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/counter-strike-2-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-limited-test-available-today\">it was initially announced</a>. Valve always said that Counter-Strike 2 would be available for everyone sometime in the summer, so there's only really one way to interpret this Tweet from the official Counter-Strike account. \"What are you doing next Wednesday?\" it asks, referring to September 27. That would <em>technically</em> put it outside of the summer season, since that ends September 23. But we don't need to be literal here. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/counter-strike-2-release-date-teaser\">Read more</a> ",
