Players can complete missions to progress through 30 Ark Pass levels, and with each level reached, new rewards will be unlocked and earned. The regular Ark Pass is completely free and grants a variety of helpful rewards, such as Pheons, honing material selection chests, pirate coins, and even a Legendary Card Pack! Ark Pass progress is earned across your entire roster, and the rewards are roster bound. While all players will have access to the free Ark Pass, those interested in more rewards and cosmetics can exchange Royal Crystals for two premium reward tracks (Premium & Super Premium) which each layer in additional rewards to the leveling track. The Premium Ark Pass adds rewards at all 30 levels earned alongside the free rewards. Examples include more honing material selection chests, battle items, rapport chests, and more! On top of the Regular & Premium rewards, the Super Premium Ark Pass weaves the Mokoko Kindergarten cosmetic collection, Pheons, and a Legendary Card Pack through the Ark Pass. ",

Players will be able to see the Jump-Start Founder's Pack in their Product Inventory in all regions but each pack is only claimable once. If a player has characters on multiple regions, whatever region they first claim the Jump-Start Founders Pack in will be bound to the region/roster it is claimed in. After that, they will no longer see the Jump-Start Founder's Pack in their Product Inventory if they log into characters on other regions. All original purchasers will see this pack in their Product Inventory, but they can only be claimed on Jump-Start Servers.

We\u2019re excited to welcome new and returning players to the shores of Arkesia and help them experience the many unique raids, dungeons, and character systems that make Lost Ark special. We recognize that the game encountered many challenges at launch, with a steep progression curve, bots, and stability issues. We\u2019ve made serious strides in addressing these and feel confident that we\u2019re in a good place to bring players back. https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/dyyy8GIXpOe12o1YTXdG9/3f8ff4374bb945ae034dcc318d3ee7e4/lost_ark_screeenshot_002_1920x1080.jpg Players on Jump-Start servers will receive materials that provide faster vertical and horizontal progression, including honing materials, card packs, and more! Find details on some of the ways we plan to help players level up in the Events & Rewards section. Players will get a South Vern pass to \u201cJump-Start\u201d a character immediately to Item Level 1415. There will be a server available in each region: West - North America - Lauriel East - North America - Azakiel Europe Central - Kayangel South America - Elgacia Jump-Start servers will be isolated from other servers, with independent PvE matchmaking, Party Finder, Marketplace, and Auction House (PvP matchmaking and rank will be shared with the rest of the region). This allows restarting players to have an independent experience that\u2019s unaffected by existing servers/regions. We will be closely monitoring the progression and populations of Jump-Start servers, and plan on reconnecting Jump-Start Servers with their respective regions within the next six months. https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/SAk3jrbkQPvY10WjgdUXk/013ea62a36c9e601489815cabc1be17e/LA_Elgacia2-1920.jpg Special Events & Rewards Jump-Start Servers will include a medley of special events to help players progress quickly and jump into the endgame. In addition to all the specific events listed below, Jump-Start Servers will also have unique Hot-time and Log-in events! South Vern Powerpass, Story Express, & Jump-Start Mokoko Express Event A Story Express event is available for Jump-Start players to quickly experience Lost Ark\u2019s story on their main or on an alternate character. Story missions will take the player from Item Level 1 to 1415. Select a Story Express Character through the \u2018Event Quest\u2019 window and clear story missions for valuable progression materials. The event will last until December 13, 2023. Any character that has not yet completed the \u2018On the Border\u2019 quest from Rethramis can become a designated Story Express character. An Event South Vern Powerpass will be available for players to use on Jump-Start Servers until December 13, 2023. Pairing well with the South Vern Powerpass, players will be able to designate one character between Item Level 1415 and 1540 on their account to participate in the Jump-Start Mokoko Express Event, where they\u2019ll have discounted honing rates and earn honing materials to quickly level up to Item Level 1540 and beyond. There\u2019s also Combat Style Setting Support options for players to easily set skills and Engravings through presets, and get item support for accessories and Ability Stones. The designated character will earn valuable rewards as they level up, including Silver, Honing Materials, Gems, Engraving Recipes, and more! The Jump-Start Mokoko Express Event also includes an Engraving Support system that lets players choose 5 Engravings to be in effect at level 3 during the event. https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/6tkCkXBYYxoqn893aueo1w/bb86677ea6e65e69549f6c4916791af8/Candaria_Territory_04_1920x1080.jpg Welcome Giveaway (First Log-in Gift) A special gift will be awaiting players who log into Jump-Start Servers! XP Boost Characters on Jump-Start Servers will have increased XP gains (200%) Roster Level XP up to Lv. 100 Character Level XP up to Lv. 60 Stronghold Level XP up to Lv. 60 Trade Skill Level XP up to Lv. 60 Exclusive Mokoko\u2019s Shining Harvest Event In this special event rewards are granted to help players rapidly progress. Clearing (and reclearing) Legion Raids, Challenge Abyssal Dungeons, Chaos Dungeons, and Challenge Guardian Raids grant extra (and valuable) rewards. The items include Relic Accessory Chests & Ability Stones, Soaring Card Packs (containing only the cards from entry card sets Deep Dive / You Have A Plan), Gold, and more! This will help players kickstart their accessory and card collections, while also helping populate the Auction House for the player-driven economy to thrive on the new servers. https://images.ctfassets.net/umhrp0op95v1/7M0iRwY82TxmQrvYcFY4XP/81a1218e908b0d1854b45863aa5c99f6/LA_Mokoko_Bloom_7_1080.jpeg Arktoberfest Exchange Shop The Event Shop on Jump-Start Servers will be different than the Event Shop on regular servers, with the goal of helping Jump-Start players progress vertically and horizontally. Jump-Start Servers will have a variety of items for players to earn by exchanging event tokens, which will help them progress their Stepping-stone Card sets, level-up their ship, Rapport, Skill Tree, and Honing. Event tokens can be gained by completing Chaos Dungeons, Guardian Raids, and by participating in the Blooming Mokoko event. Special Store Packages & Cosmetics For players looking to further enhance their characters, the Jump-Start in-game store will have special packages and items. With heavily discounted material packages to boost vertical and horizontal progression (such as Card Packs, Pheons, Silver, and Honing Materials), we want to ensure players on Jump-Start Servers looking to dive into the end-game have options that give them value. And for those looking to vanquish the demonic hordes in style, a variety of cosmetics will be returning from the vault, available exclusively on Jump-Start Servers. Jump-Start players will have plenty of cosmetic customization options available. Looking Ahead We\u2019re excited for new and returning players to experience the many unique raids, dungeons, and character systems that make Lost Ark special. Current players will have plenty to look forward to in September with Primal Island, Yoz\u2019s Jar, new Rapport Affection Ranks, a new Ark Pass, and more! We have a few more surprises and updates planned\u2014 so make sure to checkout the September Release Notes. We can\u2019t wait to hop in the Jump-Start servers with everyone on September 13. Until then, we\u2019ll see you in Arkesia. ",

The Europe West world names (Nia & Ealyn) will remain the same and will be integrated into Europe Central. No servers (and therefore rosters) are being merged into each other. Policies that merge or sum item counts will only apply to players with an account in both server regions, and players within those regions can find the specifics below. Market, Auction House, and Currency Exchange Active Market & Auction House product registrations will be cancelled ahead of the merge, along with listings on the Currency Exchange. All Action House and Market transaction history, recent transactions, and interested lists will be deleted after merge. Guild & Character Names Overlapped character names from accounts on Europe West will be reset. When logging in for the first time after the merge, players will be prompted to change their name. Overlapped Guild names from Guilds on Europe West will have a \u201c#\u201d added before their name. A Guild name change will be automatically available to the Guild Master by navigating to Guild > Management > Guild Name Change. Social Open pending requests will not be cancelled, but they will reflect the name changes due to the merge. The character names in the friend and blocked list will also reflect the changes. Recent list will not be cleared, but it will not reflect any name changes due to the merge. We will retain the global chat in Europe Central but Europe west global chats and chat history will be deleted. This means anyone who has a chat setup in Europe West will need to remake it once they are merged into Europe Central. Progression Events Super Mokoko Express & Story Express Events An event status with the higher progression between two regions will remain. In case that the progression is equal, the event info of the character with a higher Item Level will remain. Event rewards from completed missions will be added. Any unclaimed event mission rewards from the event status to be deleted, will be delivered to the Universal Inventory. Event Powerpass The lower count of Event Powerpasses will be retained. Tickets & Tokens Powerpasses, Character Slot Extension Tickets, Reskin Tickets, Name Change Tickets, and Guild Name Change Tickets will all follow the same policy: Purchased Tickets/Tokens will be added together.
