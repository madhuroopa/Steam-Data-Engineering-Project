In the years after, her home planet of Nexus established ties across the Outlands, introducing Rowenna to the Apex Games. The Games represented everything she aspired to\u2013heroism, hard work, sacrifice\u2014and she became a dedicated fan. When her elder sister Diwa suffered a terrible injury at work, Rowenna resolved to support her family no matter what. She stole the battery from the Monarch, still rusting on the hill, and had a combat rig built with its battery at the core. She used it to qualify for the Apex Games, and even though the battery exposes her to poisonous radiation, she refuses to give up. No one else was going to get hurt to support her family. Rowenna\u2019s choosing to have hope for her dreams or die trying. Now, it\u2019s Conduit\u2019s chance for a day in the sun. Check out more on our newest and brightest Legend, Conduit, in our highlights blog and read on for details on her abilities. https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/ignite-season-game-updates PASSIVE: SAVIOR\u2019S SPEED Gain a burst of speed when running toward a teammate out of Tactical range.

This notification will appear in the kill feed when a player in your current match has been removed. This alert will only be triggered by our anti-cheat systems and will not display when someone quits a match, loses connection or is kicked for AFK. This is the first of many steps the team is taking to improve visibility and player feedback when users are actioned. https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/sample-inmatch-notification.png.adapt.1456w.png RANKED NEW FEATURE: PROMOTIONAL TRIALS In Season 19, players will enter a Promotional Trial state when they reach the peak of their tier. During a Trial, LP loss and gains are frozen, allowing the player to focus on completing the trial: Completing the conditions of a Trial within the given match count limit (either by winning a game or completing the alternative) will allow promotion into the next tier with a 250 LP promotional bonus Failing to complete the Trial within the match limit results in the Trial ending and a loss of LP based on the player\u2019s performance Trials are time limited to 5 matches, increasing by 1 game each time a player fails and then reenters the same Trial, up to a max of 10 retries Promotional Trials are skipped during Provisional matches {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38098458/b54c78326014d75a191a33446255dedf9fa1df47.png RANKED TUNING If you missed our recent reddit Dev Team Update, we\u2019ve made some tuning adjustments for Ignite\u2019s Ranked: Increasing the amount of Rating Bonus given to help players\u2019 ranking catch up to their skill bracket Reduce the bonus that is withheld and thus the difficulty of climbing, when players are actively pushing against their skill ceiling Provisional Bonuses are adjusted to land players closer to the expected statistical 1.5 tier drop at the end of their 10 provisional games Ranking difference restrictions for 3 stack premades has been REMOVED.

With her shield-based abilities, let Conduit be your guiding light for regeneration and disruption. She\u2019s the spark your squad needs to become Apex Champions on the faster and deadlier Storm Point. This tempest of a map has been overhauled with a reduced size and fresh Points of Interest like The Pylon, ZEUS Station, and Devastated Coast. Last but certainly not least, the team is excited to share that Cross Progression will be rolling out starting this season. Link your platforms to an EA Account to show off your skills no matter where you squad up. NEW LEGEND: CONDUIT https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/ignite-season-game-updates/conduit-season-updates.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Conduit is like a firework\u2013warm, bright, and short-lived. To rise quickly, Rowenna must don a combat rig made of an incomplete Monarch Titan that she knows is poisoning her. But it\u2019s a price she\u2019s willing to pay for her dream of being a Legend. At home, she\u2019s the core of her large family. She smoothes over issues with her humor and sunny disposition all while hustling and sacrificing quietly\u2013something that\u2019s unchanged in the Games. Despite the fact she\u2019s exchanging her life and health to be Conduit, Rowenna is having fun because she knows the Apex Games. Expert, fan, supporter\u2013she\u2019s there and she has the replays saved and filed, and her teammates and rivals know she\u2019s there to win! STORM POINT MAP UPDATE Storm Point is a map that is loved by our competitive community for its more predictable pacing and high loot quality. However, some of the elements of Storm Point that make it a great competitive map can also make it more difficult to quickly find action during casual play. This brings us to the team's primary goal for this update, which is to improve the fun factor without sacrificing competitive integrity. To do this, we\u2019ve taken the following actions: Add attractive, central POIs for players searching for combat. Wattson\u2019s Pylon and CETO Station provide central hot drops for players looking to fight early. Reduce overall map size to improve mid-game pacing. Significant map size reductions to both the southern coastline and northern mountainous areas make these zones more attractive for early combat and reduce the overall distance between squads. Reduce friction of central rotations. With CETO Station replacing Prowler Island and a reworked Prowler-less Forbidden Zone, rotations through the center of map have never been smoother. IMC ARMORIES https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/ignite-season-game-updates/armory.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg Unfortunately, the IMC Spectres failed to defend Storm Point from the storm, leaving only ravaged husks of the armories behind. Expect some high tier loot to remain \u2013 but the Spectres will no longer defend the spoils. REWORKED AREA: FORBIDDEN ZONE https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/ignite-season-game-updates/forbidden.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg The Forbidden Zone was hit hard by lightning during the storm, destroying parts of the perimeter fence and causing the Prowlers to flee! Our goal for this area was to reduce the friction of rotating through the zone by removing the Prowlers, but also providing structures to build better fronts and defensive options when squads are forced into combat. REWORKED AREA: LIGHTNING ROD One of the biggest opportunities we wanted to address with this update was to solve for the low number of players choosing to drop on the high side of the map. In addition to adding ZEUS Station, the team felt that it was important to reduce the overall size of this zone to help make these POIs feel better connected to one another and the rest of Storm Point. And that\u2019s just about everything! The team is looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the new Storm Point and playing with you all. See you in the ring! CROSS PROGRESSION With the launch of Season 19, we\u2019re excited to roll out Cross Progression in a phased deployment across existing platforms in Apex Legends\u2122. Keep an eye out for an in-game prompt to initiate the Cross Progression migration which will bring together your content and progression.

Equip them to your wheel to use them while in-flight! Once deployed, Holosprays will follow your flight path for a limited time or until a Skydive Emote or different Holospray is used.

With it, the game is getting the usual spread of map reworks, a new Legend for players to mess around with, a battle pass with new cosmetics, etc. But it's also getting something special - a feature fans have been asking about for years now. Apex Legends is getting cross progression. As soon as the season starts, Apex Legends players with multiple accounts spread across PC and consoles will have their accounts merged into one master account. Your highest rank across your accounts will carry over, as will all your cosmetics which will be compiled into one neat collection. We're not quite sure yet how duplicate cosmetics will work, but fingers crossed that you get a nice amount of in-game currency. This is obviously great news for longtime players, especially those who may have a stray legendary skin lost on an old console (<a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-switch-trailer.\">or even the dreaded Apex Legends Switch version</a>) that they've been leaving to gather dust for a while now. Cross progression is one of those features that have been demanded by a subset of the community for a while now - almost as much as the push to make <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/apex-legends-everything-on-control\">certain limited time modes permanent</a>.
