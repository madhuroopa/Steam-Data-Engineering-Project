No longer decreases Power cooldown by 25%. Environment/Maps The maximum number of pallets spawned in the Shattered Square Map has been increased to 18 to prevent large areas of the map from spawning with no pallets. The quality of the loops were also updated to reduce their safety. We hope this adds better gameplay for both roles. Note: The map is not guaranteed to generate with this many pallets and will instead prematurely stop spawning pallets if the minimum pallet requirement has been reached and there are no more valid positions far enough from other pallets. Bug Fixes Audio Memory fragment shards that have been collected or have despawned no longer produce SFX. Characters Fixed an issue that caused The Huntress reload animation to cause motion sickness when paired with the Iron Maiden perk. Fixed an issue that caused The Xenomorph pick-up animation from a Locker to jitter in a specific Locker inside the Main Building. Fixed an issue that caused the heads of all female Survivors to clip through the Hook during the struggle phase. Fixed an issue that caused The Legion's upper body to be contorted while the camera snaps back into position after performing Memento Mori. Fixed an issue that allowed The Cannibal's camera to clip through Lockers when performing a basic attack on them. Fixed an issue that caused survivors to experience clipping with the artist when picking up and putting down survivors. The Demogorgon\u2019s Portals\u2019 auras now properly appear after having performed a Mori. Environment/Maps Fixed a potentially broken Killer spawn point on Nostromo Wreckage. Fixed a killer blocking collision on MacMillan Estate Realm. Fixed an issue on Suffocation Pit where the Nightmare could not place his Dream Snares. Fixed a killer blocking collision issue on the Temple of Purgation. Fixed an issue where branches of trees could clip through the main building in Eyrie of Crows. Fixed an issue where the Tonic Fumes of the clown could go through ceiling in buildings of the MacMillan Estate Realm. Fixed an issue on Raccoon City Police Station where The Nemesis' tentacles could go through walls. Fixed an issue in Coldwind Farm where items could be hidden in the ground near the corn rows. Fixed an issue on Disturbed Ward where survivors could heal each other through walls. Updated the layout of the combine harvester where small killers could not interact with survivors that are standing on one side. Fixed an issue where players could land on top of pews in the Father Campbell's Chapel. Fixed an issue in Eyrie of Crows where survivors healing each other can end up stuck in roots. Event - Haunted By Daylight Lighting now properly resets when entering the Void during The Dredge\u2019s Nightfall or while in The Nightmare\u2019s Dreamworld. Killer - The Skull Merchant Claw traps are propertly destroyed when a survivor disconnects without being replaced by a bot in a Custom Game. The Map now properly tracks the Skull Merchant\u2019s\u2019 drones when equipped with Red Twine Add-On. Misc Fixed an issue that could disconnect players mid-trial. ",

In case you missed our recent Livestream, we\u2019ve got you covered with this complete guide to all things Haunted by Daylight. Atmosphere To Die For From October 18th, 2:00 PM ET \u2013 November 6th, 2:00 PM ET, Haunted by Daylight will take over the Entity\u2019s Realm, tainting it with the mysterious presence of the Void Realm. Not only that, but familiar sights like Generators and Hooks will also undergo a spooky transformation. The Bloodweb will also see the return of the Will O' Wisp Flashlight, the All Hallows' Eve Lunchbox Med-Kit, the Blight Serum, and the Arcane Dowsing Rod Bloodpoint Offering. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/c69f8abeb1dff6c38d0b34173cb34c6e5daee2a2.jpg The Void Beckons This year marks the arrival of the Void Realm, a terrifying Realm created by The Entity as a wasteland for its discarded...playthings. For the first time, the Void Realm is explorable, and its presence will have an immediate impact on Trials for both Killer and Survivor. So how does it all come together on the gameplay side? {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/a34b933ef727d9fa06a0976f81d5ee413c1b399c.jpg Collect Void Energy Like last year, players must complete specific objectives to collect Void Energy: Survivor Repairing Halloween Generators Stunning a Killer carrying Void Energy Destroying a Pumpkin Killer Hooking Survivors on Halloween Hooks Downing a Survivor carrying Void Energy Destroying a Pumpkin {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/301dbac9503aaf480be65ddd1870378166efb290.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/74ad337b2b6c514b02da165025985065484db23f.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/0619ead5e27b58f038b527e0ad4aa8b0e48552a5.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/9598eefafd96d7e560c3e4c3f59de3627d0003c4.jpg They can also collect Void Orbs, which float toward the player when approached. After sufficient Void Energy has been collected, seek out one of four Unstable Rifts to deposit your haul and activate that Rift. Once enough collective Void Energy has been deposited across all Unstable Rifts, all Rifts will become portals to the Void Realm, which you will be free to enter. Entering The Void When you step into the Void Realm, don\u2019t be alarmed. Okay, you can be somewhat alarmed. Killers will be Undetectable while in the Void Realm, but they will not be able to use their Powers. At the same time, Survivors will be Exhausted and Broken (if already injured or injured in The Void Realm). You won\u2019t find any Generators, Pallets, Lockers, Chests, or Totems in the Void Realm. There are Hooks, but when a Survivor is placed on one, they will instantly be transported to a Hook on the Map. There are ghostly figures called Haunts, the spirits of all those drained and discarded by The Entity. Provide them with 12 Void Energy to Capture them and release them from the Void and into the Map. Note that The Void will close a) 2 minutes after spawning, or b) once all available Haunts have been released. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/9c09832993e0512432bc1fbee4d5a948834a6121.jpg HAUNT-ed By Daylight Once a Haunt has been released, their Aura is revealed. From there, it can impact players in various ways, acting as either a boon or a trap. For Survivors who complete the Release they will immediately gain a boost for a brief duration, consisting of Haste, Endurance, and 20% faster Action Speed. Their held Item will also be refilled to 50%. For Killers who completed the Release, they will also immediately gain a boost for a brief duration, consisting of Haste, Undetectable, and 20% faster Action and Cooldown speed. If a Survivor approaches a Haunt Released by a Survivor, they will briefly receive the Haste speed boost. If a Killer approaches a Haunt Released by a Survivor, they will briefly become Hindered. If a Killer approaches a Haunt they have Released, they will receive a brief Haste speed boost. If a Survivor approaches a Haunt Released by a Killer, their camera will lock onto the Haunt (similar to a Hag\u2019s Phantasm Trap), and they\u2019ll temporarily become Hindered. Pumpkin Time It wouldn\u2019t be Halloween without a few Pumpkins scattered around the Map. As is tradition, destroying a Pumpkin will lead to one of three outcomes: the Haste Status Effect, the Hindered Status Effect, or nothing at all. Event Tome + Halloween Rewards It wouldn\u2019t be Halloween without treats, and we\u2019ve got you covered with plenty of earnable rewards to unlock . This year, you\u2019ll be able to earn Dark Trinkets by completing challenges in the Haunted by Daylight Event Tome, which can then be used to purchase Haunted by Daylight Cosmetics for both Killer and Survivor: Survivor Skeleton Shirts: Nea Karlsson \u2013 Painted Skeleton Shirt Kate Denson \u2013 Musical Rib-Cage Shirt Yui Kimura \u2013 Bone Handlebar Shirt Mikaela Reid \u2013 Celestial Skeleton Shirt Haddie Kaur \u2013 Card Reader Shirt Vittorio Toscano \u2013 Carved Bones Shirt {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/d02d8b0e74374b44832f081fdc2225a6692ae405.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/e810a19f13c63388c0fb21be05444b1157795c6b.jpg Killer Candy Weapons: The Wraith \u2013 Sweet Blade The Huntress \u2013 Jaw Slasher The Legion \u2013 Syrupy Knife The Deathslinger \u2013 Chocolate Spike The Dredge \u2013 Chewing Blade The Skull Merchant \u2013 Candy Breaker Blade {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/763fc21da71afb0975408584775995efc66bffe8.jpg {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/2ef5b1e2afdae742f7d904d2e4d2bffabf5b6297.jpg In addition, Cosmetics and Charms can also be unlocked by completing the Event Tome, including several pieces of a new Outfit for The Knight and Meg Thomas: Outfits The Knight \u2013 Jack O'Lantern (BODY + WEAPON) Meg Thomas \u2013 Candy Night (TORSO + LEGS) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/1ee6bbae0947525fcc859f72cf5cb94aed687506.jpg Charms Void Pumpkin Buried Candy Little Scoundrel Little Sweetie Scarecrow Jake Huntress Werewolf {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/7cc26c42e914b619110be9903129e065ff25a52e.jpg This Event also features several Milestone Rewards, which can only be earned after unlocking enough Cosmetics.

Seasonal Collections Halloween is all about choosing the right costume, and we\u2019re bringing out several terrifying Collections for the occasion, including a few returning seasonal favorites. On October 18th, head to the in-game store and check out the Tricks And Treats Collection and The Void Collection, followed by the Hallowed Blight Collection on October 24th.

You lurk in the shadows, eliminating your victims one by one. When your Obsession is hooked, gain Undetectable and a 5% Haste status effect for 14/16/18 seconds. (new functionality) Survivor Perk Updates Background Player When the Killer picks-up another Survivor, Background Player activates for 10 seconds. When you start running, break into a sprint at 200% of your normal Running Movement speed for 5 seconds. (was 150% for 4 seconds) This perk cannot be used while suffering from Exhaustion. This perk causes exhaustion for 60/50/40 seconds. Updated Killer: The Skull Merchant Eyes in the Sky The Skull Merchant begins the match with six Drones. Press the Power button to deploy a Drone, which conducts an invisible, continuous sweeping scan. If a Survivor is detected, the Drone becomes active, which makes the Drone\u2019s scan lines visible. Once detected by a scan line, a Survivor gains scan immunity and cannot be detected by other scan lines for 3 seconds. Survivors can attempt to hack Drones. Failure activates the Drone and partially fills their Lock On meter; Success disables the Drone for 45 seconds. Removed the Active Zone (cylinder). Removed remote Activation of Drones. The Killer now starts with 6 drones. The minimum distance between drones is now 16 meters. The Drone radius is now 10 meters. Radar Press the Ability Button to open a Radar to see the locations of Survivors detected by Drones or those with Claw Traps. Each Survivor detected on the Radar increases The Skull Merchant\u2019s movement speed. The Radar can also recall drones or change the direction of their scan rotation. Lock On The Lock On meter fills when scanned by a Drone and when failing to disable a Drone. When the meter is full, the Survivor receives a Claw Trap, becomes Injured, and suffers from the Broken status effect. Additional scans briefly apply the Hindered status effect. A Claw Trap broadcasts the Survivor\u2019s location to the Killer and is only removed when its battery dies. Removed the Exposed status effect from Lock On. Add-Ons Adi Valente #1: Effects last until the Claw Trap is removed. High-Power Floodlight: Blindness status applied when receiving a Claw Trap. Effects last until the Claw Trap is removed. Geographical Readout: Increased action speed bonus while breaking pallets and breakable walls, damaging generators, and vaulting to 20% (up from 15%).

Effects last 6 seconds (up from 3 seconds). Randomised Strobes: Increases Hindered status by 1 second when a Survivor is detected by a drone. Advanced Movement Prediction: Reveals Survivor\u2019s aura when they receive a Claw Trap. Ultrasonic Speaker (formerly, \u201cUltrasonic Trap Speaker\u201d): Decreases scan immunity duration. Expired Batteries: Decreases Claw Trap battery life (50%, instead of 60%). Increases Haste status granted when Survivors are detected on the radar. Prototype Rotor: Increases drone rotation speed. Iridescent Unpublished Manuscript: When a drone is disabled, the drone gains a 32m terror radius for 15 seconds. During this time, The Skull Merchant gains the Undetectable status effect. Other Daily rituals, Achievements, Loading Tips, and Score Events have been updated accordingly. Updated Killer: The Trapper When setting a Bear-Trap, The Trapper gets a Haste effect of 7.5% for 5 seconds (new effect). The Coffee Grounds Addon has been updated to indicate it is an additional Haste effect. When the Trial begins, 8 Bear-Traps spawn on the map (was 6). Other Killer Tweaks Huntress Reloading hatchets takes 3 seconds (was 4 seconds). Deathslinger Reloading takes 2.6 seconds (was 2.75 seconds) Addon: Warden's Keys - Decreases the Speargun's reload time by 0.35 seconds (was 0.5 seconds) Addon: Jaw Smasher - Increases movement speed by 1.5% while aiming down the Speargun's sights (was 1%). Addon: Wanted Poster - Increases movement speed by 3% while aiming down the Speargun's sights (was 2.5%). Legion Addon: BFFs - Earn tokens for hitting Survivors during Feral Frenzy: Second chained hit: 2 tokens. Third chained hit: 3 tokens. Fourth chained hit: 4 tokens. Fifth chained hit: 5 tokens. Once the gates are powered, if more than 15 or more tokens have been collected, gain a 6% movement speed boost when not using Feral Frenzy (was 4%). Trickster Reloading knives takes 3 seconds (was 4 seconds). Anti Face-Camp Feature Survivors on the hook have an internal \"camp meter\" which fills when the Killer is nearby. The meter fills faster the closer the Killer is, but is slower when other Survivors are near (never becomes negative). Once the meter is full, the Survivor gets a prompt allowing them to escape the hook with 100% probability. Survivors who take this action gain Endurance for 15 seconds. This feature shuts off entirely once the Exit Gates are powered. As part of this system, the Cannibal can no longer hit a Survivor who has Endurance twice in the same 0.5 second timespan. Map Updates Shattered Square Map Update The Shattered Square Map received a lot of comments at release. Some issues were related to the objects being low to the ground and hard to see, especially when it came to Killers that are navigating with a first person camera. We did a clean up and made sure that the loops feel smoother. There were also inconsistencies with our visual and navigation language. Objects were placed in a way that it felt possible to simply climb, because of similar angles to stairs or slopes found in other maps. This was resolved by taking away some of the objects or placing assets that match the collisions. The line of sight was very low and gave the ability for players to see across the map. A clear line of sight can be detrimental for both roles depending of the play style. We have changed the positioning of tiles with higher line of sight blockers to be more predominent. The size of the Map was large and we decided to reduce the size to encourage encounters, make it more dynamic and reduce the time to find interactables (generators, hooks, totems, chest, etc.) MacMillan Estate Realm Update The Maps of the MacMillan Estate Realm have been in the game for about 7 years. The layouts and other information have been available within the community for a while, but The Entity reminded us to give players a chaotic experience. Therefore, we are adding new variations of the MacMillan Estate Realm maps to the existing pool. Features Bots Improvements Reworked the Bots Skill Check system: Success rates now correlate with Skill Check size. Skill Check debuffs, such as The Doctor's Madness or Hex: Huntress Lullaby, reduce the odds of hitting the Skill Check. Bug Fixes Archives Fixed an issue that prevented several challenges that have to be completed in the Basement from gaining progress. Fixed an issue that allowed the Deadly Senses and You Can\u2019t Hide Challenges to gain progress when hitting a survivor with a Killer\u2019s Special Attack.

Fixed an issue where the \"Swarm of Darkness\" Master Challenge did not correctly display the Player's progress. Fixed an issue where the \"Cellar Search\" Master Challenge did not award progress from the chest in the Killer's basement. \"Remix\" challenges no longer prevent the selection of random Perks on consecutive Trials on the same character. Audio Fixed an issue that caused the Hooked On You music not being played on Trickster's Paradise Beatdown outfit. Fixed an issue where the French voice didn't match the text in Tome 15 \"The Absolutely Horrifying Maniacal Puppet Show. Guest Starring, Ashy Slashy. 2.\" Entry. Fixed an issue that prevented The Xenomorph to hear Generators while in Tunnels. Bots Bots can now attempt to self-unhook. Bots now break a stare-down with the Killer earlier when standing still on opposite sides of a Remote Flame Turret. Bots now try to look for potential Killer approach paths when doing long interactions, taking breaks from turning the camera slowly around. Characters Fixed an issue that caused any Survivors grabbed by the Trapper while vaulting towards him to be seen clipping into the ground. Fixed an issue that caused The Doctor to able to see inside of Lockers by walking into them. Fixed an issue that caused survivor Yun-Jin Lee's Tome 17 'Smart Outfit' arm to break when using a flashlight. Fixed an issue that caused the Camera to clips through Wraith's 'Saber-Toothed' weapon after hitting a survivor. Fixed an issue that cause the camera not to transition properly when using the Cenobite\u2019s Summons of Pain. Fixed an issue causing The Xenomorph's tail attack to be able to hit Survivors behind it Fixed an issue causing The Xenomorph's tail attack animation not to match the collision Environment/Maps Fixed an issue in Lery's Hospital where the side of a generator was blocked by assets Fixed an issue in Pale Rose where a groups of blockers were too close and prevented possible navigation between them Perks Fixed an issue that caused the Territorial Imperative perk not to activate when a Survivor enters the basement.

Fixed an issue that caused the Blood Pact Perk\u2019s icon to appear dimmed when the Haste effect is active. Platforms Fixed a crash on Nintendo Switch that could happen when interacting with the Friends menu. UI For consoles, the Loadout search bar virtual keyboard now appears in the player's selected language rather than English. In the Store UI, exclamation marks for content in a new DLC will now correctly disappear on viewing that content. The name of the character properly changes when changing to a preset with a Legendary outfit equipped. Wait for mystery box animation to complete before advancing Bloodweb to next level. Misc Equipped Charms are now always visible on the displayed character in the Store. Fixed an issue that caused the Flame Turret\u2019s light to remain visible while vaulting. EDITED: Fixed a bug that resulted in a different distance achieved between male and female Survivors during fast vaults. Public Test Build (PTB) Adjustments Bots Bots no longer pick up Items with nearly no charges remaining. Fixed a crash that could occur when playing with a Bot having the Reassurance Perk.

The Randomized Stobes Add-On properly increases the duration of the Hindered status by 1 second. The Adi Valente #1 Add-On properly reduces skill checks by 20% and not 50%. Anti Face-Camp Feature Added 7 second grace period for the Killer to be able to leave the area before the system kicks in. Carrying a Survivor in the radius stops the progress bar from building up. Dying Survivors in the radius slow down the progress bar. Vertical distances are now treated differently to avoid unintentionally triggering the system through floors. Perk Updates Furtive Chase Changed functionality: when hooking the Obsession, gain Undetectable and a 5% Haste status effect for 14/16/18 seconds. Background Player Increased sprint speed to 200%. Sprint Burst no longer triggers at the same time as the Background Player Perk. Shattered Square Map Update Reviewed loops that were noted as too strong and reduced the number of pallets spawning in the map. Misc Fixed a crash that could occur in the Splash Screen. The Sacrificial Ward Offering no longer disables Map Repeat Prevention. The Shape\u2019s arm no longer stretches during the standing Mori from the Survivor\u2019s perspective. ",

                "contents": "Greetings ghosts and ghouls! We\u2019re back with another Developer Update, this time covering all the adjustments on the way following our last Public Test Build (PTB). We unveiled some major changes during this PTB, including the new Anti Face-Camping mechanic and an overhaul to The Skull Merchant\u2019s Power. You\u2019ve left us with plenty of feedback to go through, and we\u2019d like to share a few tweaks we\u2019ll be making when this update goes live (and a few more in the minor patches that follow)! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/1a83c12b3924ba42b74a92f1f35a0b329a902a84.png The Skull Merchant With the overhaul on the PTB, we set our sights on the frustrating strategies that emerged due to how The Skull Merchant\u2019s Power worked. While we\u2019re pleased to see that she was no longer a gen-defending powerhouse, we noticed many felt that she was left in a weaker state. The intent of this update is not to weaken this Killer overall, so we\u2019ll be making a series of adjustments to address some of the feedback we received. Scanning During the PTB, many Killers reported having difficulties scanning Survivors with their drones, making the frequency of Lock On lower than we\u2019d like. To ensure that her Eyes in the Sky are a truly tools of torment (sorry), we have a series of changes in store. First, we noticed that because drones always rotated clockwise, it was far less likely that Survivors would be scanned if they were also running a loop clockwise since the beams would cross their path less often. This is most noticeable on tiles which Survivors ideally want to run in a clockwise direction anyway to line themselves up for a fast vault. To remedy this, The Skull Merchant can now toggle the direction her drones rotate while using her radar. This way, you can swap directions to force the beam to cross a Survivor\u2019s path more often. Experienced Killers who know the best ways to run certain tiles will also be able to pre-emptively choose the best direction for the loop they\u2019ve deployed their drone in. Second, some found drone management to be a little stressful, largely since recalling a drone would put your Power on cooldown. This forced the Killer to rush to recall drones that are no longer needed whenever they had a moment of downtime so their Power was ready for their next chase. To address this, drones can now be recalled at any time and recalling a drone no longer incurs a cooldown. Eyes in the Sky Third, we\u2019ve made a series of smaller adjustments to make it harder for Survivors to cross through a drone\u2019s effective area without being scanned: Increased the drone\u2019s radius to 10m (was 8m). Increased the drone\u2019s rotation speed in Stealth Mode to 60 degrees per second (was 50). Increased the drone\u2019s rotation speed in Scouting Mode to 85 degrees per second (was 75). Lastly, to give The Skull Merchant more control when deploying a drone, the drone\u2019s beams now face directly in front and behind her by default, allowing skilled Killers to scan Survivors as soon as they\u2019re deployed. We have also decreased the drone\u2019s initialization time to 0.3 seconds (was 1.5 seconds) so they activate more quickly and feel more responsive. Combined, these changes will make The Skull Merchant feel better to play and more consistent now that her drones can\u2019t be used to defend generators. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/5dfb4bbe85fff2d79a526b2985f6523bc8788ad7.png Anti Face-camping Anti Face-camping is here- and so is the Killer. This mechanic aims to provide Survivors with counterplay for some of the most egregious cases of camping. From what we observed on the PTB, the system seems to come to the rescue when needed most, though we\u2019ll of course continue monitoring and make adjustments as needed. However, there were a few rough edges which we\u2019re looking to refine before this goes live. Grace Period One of the most common critiques of this mechanic comes from the way the meter immediately starts to fill before the Killer could possibly walk away. Although this alone wouldn\u2019t cause Survivors to free themselves, this understandably feels as if the game is wrongly treating you as if you\u2019re camping. There will now be a 7 second grace period before the meter starts filling after hooking a Survivor. This will give the Killer an opportunity to walk away before the system kicks in, with a little wiggle room to kick a nearby generator or reload at a locker. Dying & Carried Survivors During the PTB, dying and carried Survivors did not influence the fill rate of the meter. The former led to some awkward scenarios where a dying Survivor with a Perk that allowed them to pick themselves up could force the Killer to stay nearby, while the latter both exacerbated that strategy as well as punishing the Killer for hooking multiple Survivors in the basement. Therefore, dying will slow the meter (as though they were standing) so long as they are in the area, and carried Survivors now pause the progress bar completely. Verticality When this feature was tested on the PTB, it treated both horizontal and vertical distances equally. However, this had a side effect of detecting Killers on different floors as camping even if the shortest path to the hooked Survivor was rather long. This was especially noticeable on indoor maps such as The Game. In a later update, the meter will be weighted more heavily toward horizontal distance than vertical. This will make the meter a little more forgiving if the Killer passes by on another floor. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/7dc1d47b29c20f66f8fffe2606067ed9a3db07d6.png Perk Updates We received a bunch of feedback on the two Perks which were tweaked in this past PTB, so we went back to the drawing board to deliver a new set of changes. Furtive Chase We initially increased the terror radius reduction for each token, though many still did not find this a very appealing choice. Furtive Chase will be receiving a rework when the update goes live. When hooking the Obsession, gain Undetectable and a 5% Haste status effect for 14/16/18 seconds. When the Obsession is rescued from the hook, the rescuer becomes the Obsession (unchanged). With this new version, Furtive Chase rewards the Killer for switching targets and allows them to find a new Survivor to chase more quickly after hooking. Background Player This Perk is most often used for saving teammates, allowing you to get into position quickly in key moments. However, since the Killer\u2019s pickup animation is shorter than the Perk\u2019s duration, it would usually be too late to save your teammate by the time the speed boost ended. Therefore, Background Player now causes you to sprint at 200% speed (was 150%) for 5 seconds (was 4 seconds) when the Killer picks up a dying Survivor. This way, Background Player will allow you to cover more distance quicker than before, potentially allowing you to get into position in time to make the save. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/2beb489433cf2f5784f7378c6385353c1a211b01.png The Trapper We were delighted to see such a positive reaction to the adjustments we made to The Trapper. As we dug through the PTB feedback, we noticed many of you found it impractical to wander so far to gather your traps at the start of the match. While The Trapper is still in the spotlight, we\u2019ve decided to make one more change as soon as we\u2019re able to. The Trapper\u2019s Bear-Traps will spawn closer to generators. This way, you\u2019ll have to stray less from your usual patrol routes than before to collect a trap. Unfortunately, we weren\u2019t able to squeeze this change into the initial release, but this will be a part of one of the smaller patches in the coming weeks! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/1e68db44016b90397858daf0d93e2aa00b35653c.png Shattered Square Last but certainly not least, we have a few more adjustments on the way for the Shattered Square. We received some feedback regarding the strength of certain pallet loops and the number of pallets overall. For the update\u2019s release, we have reviewed the loops in question and slightly reduced the number of pallets which spawn. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/11814497/370a6790885cffd46d0d84494d046c14bb27ca09.png And that brings us to the end of this Developer Update! We want to thank you as always for taking the time to test out the changes on the PTB. Nearly all the adjustments mentioned in this post will be available when the update releases, with the rest following in a minor patch shortly after. We look forward to hearing what you think! Until next time\u2026 The Dead by Daylight team",
