Players will explore the familiar yet unsettling panoramas of The Pale Heart, the first linear destination in Destiny 2. When the campaign has been completed, there's plenty more coming. In the new raid, Guardians will confront the Witness head on and try to break its hold on The Pale Heart. But even that might not be enough... the culmination of the Light and Darkness Saga is upon us, and all Guardians must answer the call if we want to overcome The Final Shape and the Witness once and for all.
