BlackCell Additional Skin: Velikan\u2019s enhanced BlackCell Skin variant adds gold embellishments and a darker shade of armor embellished by electric-blue trim. Mila Also Joins the Fight Via Battle Pass {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/5606d232e42c0db12acdb7c01afcdccc5fa61f0f.jpg Although her bio is ], Mila is a powerful warrior who fights for KORTAC across Multiplayer, Special Ops, and any Call of Duty: Warzone modes.

BlackCell owners get eight additional Operator Skins with enhanced black-and-gold aesthetics when completing certain HVT Sectors across the AO. These Operators are no pawns; they are ready to pull double duty to stop Konni, regardless of their allegiance. \u201cThe Bishop\u201d Skins for Alex (Sector E13, HVT) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/45bdf5ed6d6c289db8ce4d49ce4d7e477a1d37c7.jpg Battle Pass Skin: Alex prepares for heavy fighting in a helmet and fatigues, sturdy boots, and a beige vest topped off with ammo and gear. BlackCell Additional Skin: Heavy armor with big style. This black and gold set means business, his prosthetic leg reinforced and recolored to match. \u201cBad Bishop\u201d Skins for Roze (Sector E14, HVT) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/ce40e07b276e52dd64f2fcd0ec48d3d2931d2d81.jpg Battle Pass Skin: Equipped in medium armor balancing mobility and defense, Roze additionally conceals her identity behind a mask, preserving anonymity in the field. BlackCell Additional Skin: To match her tricked out armor, Roze opts for a golden mask and emits a green and blue hue in her animated BlackCell alternate Skin. \u201cThe Rook\u201d Skins for Ghost (Sector E17, HVT) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/67583dc400ffba497d60c49a34f5cbff2e5295e8.jpg Battle Pass Skin: The perfect gear for the desert landscape of Fort Resurgence, \u201cThe Rook\u201d finds Ghost in a cape and his signature mask, exchanging his typical dark colors for a more muted beige, brown, and white. BlackCell Additional Skin: Trade the muted look for a striking black and gold variant, featuring topographical designs over the pants and jacket, as well as gilded strips along his hood and cape. New Weapon HVTs in Sectors E7, E8 Season 05 brings two new, free functional weapons to unlock in the Battle Pass: the long-distance Carrack .300 and the rapid-fire FR Avancer. Carrack .300 Sniper Rifle (Sector E7, HVT, Free)\u00a0{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/5fd9eeed4da9f2386a698cf30fdbc5342beab101.jpg This semi-auto bullpup sniper rifle features an exceptionally high fire rate and is capable of putting multiple rounds into targets at long distances. Operators seeking a fast-firing yet accurate Sniper Rifle should look no further than the Carrack .300. While it may not possess the power-per-bullet of its harder-hitting companions, this weapon is still capable of inflicting heavy damage from a distance with proper shot placement to the head down to the upper chest. In fact, its strength lies in its ability to deliver quick follow-up shots so long as the Operator behind it handles its high vertical recoil. Use the Gunsmith to fashion the Carrack .300 into a highly mobile and fast-handling weapon for aggressive play. Alternatively, with the right attachments, an Operator can lean into its strengths by extending its damage range and stabilizing its recoil for sturdy longshots. Find your preferred balance and reap the rewards in long-range fights no matter the operation. FR Avancer Assault Rifle (Sector E8, HVT, Free)\u00a0{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/1fe44ad1f38419459b2dda1476b9a66ace55dc86.jpg With a blinding fire rate and exceptional maneuverability, in the right hands, this aggressive bullpup rifle can dominate the battlefield. Shred enemies with this midrange bullpup rifle that features a rapid-fire rate and a strong vertical recoil to match. Its solid hip-fire spread and high damage per minute make it a phenomenal weapon up close in addition to its \u201ccategory standard\u201d range for all Assault Rifles. And with a recoil pattern that\u2019s easy to learn, an Operator with a steady hand or trigger discipline can make this tool a devastating Primary Weapon in any operation that calls for close- to midrange combat. The Gunsmith allows Operators to maximize efficiency with the FR Avancer. Equip it with an extended magazine, or a Laser for improved aiming capabilities, an Underbarrel for recoil control, a Stock to counter mobility penalties from other attachments, and a red dot Optic for better visibility. . . . Or do all of the above in a well-balanced yet powerful combination fit for fighting entire squads. New Weapon Blueprints, Vehicle Skins A larger game is looming over the Battle Pass. . . . The Weapon Blueprints on offer give you plenty of moves to make no matter the mode, allowing you to put even the most worthy of opponents in serious checkmate. King Hunter \u2014 Assault Rifle (Sector E1, HVT) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/9e6a8f6c6dad31567d809ee9f4639fee4ff6a787.jpg Cool off with this cobalt-blue Assault Rifle Blueprint unlockable right at the normal starting position in the Battle Pass.

Banneret \u2014 SMG (Sector E12, HVT) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/18d5242e6881ce80edbd2d89a4740fbf7607393b.jpg Based off the SMG introduced in Season 04, the \u201cBanneret\u201d is a Shadow Company\u2013themed weapon featuring a bloodred skull design and a balanced attachment setup. Customized with an extended damage range plus improved recoil control and stability, the \u201cBanneret\u201d is a capable tool against enemies up close and at midrange. Raider \u2014 Battle Rifle (Sector E14, Non-HVT) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/4b4f34c43ead55a966fc0ef28fe9f19d30cfc5a8.jpg For Shadow Company Operators, the \u201cRaider\u201d Weapon Blueprint features a precision sight picture along with improvements to aiming stability and recoil control.

Get the \u201cMagnitude\u201d Heavy Tank Skin in Sector E15; if its skull-inlaid, white paint job doesn\u2019t scare off the enemy, it\u2019s black and gold cannon and turret sure will. In Sector E2, access the \u201cWheeled Steed\u201d Dirt Bike, which includes an additional BlackCell Skin variant. Remember: BlackCell owners get that variant Skin as well as another Vehicle Skin variant as part of the full BlackCell offering in Season 05.

                "contents": "Strike Urzikstan Day 278, 11:00 Factions Deployed: SpecGru / KorTac In this sprawling urban center, there\u2019s danger at every corner and enough traversable buildings to make you check both high and low when approaching the next objective. The map\u2019s larger size provides ample opportunity to get into position before the fight begins. Will you move up in haste to bring the battle to the enemy right away, or melt into one of many power positions, waiting for the enemy to come stumbling into your line of sight? In this iconic 6v6 Core Multiplayer map \u2013 first released in the original Call of Duty\u00ae 4: Modern Warfare\u00ae and re-released in Modern Warfare 2 (2009) \u2013 launching with Season 05 in Call of Duty\u00ae: Modern Warfare\u00ae II, the possibilities are endless. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/1620e5ff51e201b637a4ee32cd8786d1581d854f.jpg KorTac Spawn Zone (Northeast) \u2014 Junkyard Starting from the Junkyard, KorTac forces have several options at the start of the match, with each path catering somewhat to a certain type of Loadout. Midranged Loadouts perform well through the southern Market route; prepare to engage at the dividing wall. Those with closer-ranged Loadouts may prefer to book it toward the western Clock Tower, using its pedestal and the surrounding buildings to cut sightlines short. For snipers, the real prize is found along the central Main Street, a long route with little visual obstruction down the length of it. A two-story building is essentially the \u201chero\u201d of the map for these sharpshooters, as it will become a power position and focal point for combat early and often during a match. Spawn Point: SpecGru {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/b8b9f7ab0ec21278f60ff8754d55602b2ee8663a.jpg SpecGru Spawn Zone (South) \u2014 Hill From the southern Hill location, fast SpecGru Operators can get the advantage over the Clock Tower by rushing north to the second story of the Main Store. From here, you\u2019ll have a powerful vantage point over the eastern half of the tower. You might also head east and up the Flower Shop stairs for a vantage point over enemies coming through the Market. For snipers and other long-ranged Loadouts, consider booking it to the west end of Main Street, where you\u2019re likely to encounter enemy snipers on the other side, so be ready to engage. Map Maneuvers: Route Planning {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/8aca8c99be2e132428e0e48e52697b0ceabe488c.jpg For the purposes of this guide, we\u2019re dividing Strike into seven main sections: Junkyard and Market Apartment Clock Tower Shops Main Street Hill Flower Shop {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/51dbba7091dbf45b7e4430e2bc6a4131a7fd8be5.jpg Junkyard and Market Starting in the northeast and running south through the Market, this section offers a great means of moving up and down the map without being exposed to the central Main Street. Its narrow layout and plentiful cover pieces allow close- and midranged Loadouts to shine in a map where long distances are the mainstay. There\u2019s also easy access to the Apartment and Electronics Store for making a push west, both offering valuable cover when combat gets heated. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/62024b4c7a360f4e81572851111dcffff90736f7.jpg Apartment Easy to spot by the big \u201cLaundry\u201d sign hanging out front, the Apartment marks a critical point in the northeast section of the map, standing guard over the Junkyard, Market, Crashed Car, and the roads leading toward the Clock Tower and Main Street. Its two levels offer multiple points from which to launch an attack, so an active player can attack on all sides. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/d8f1613a56cedaffaedccfc900e6d80c31cc19e8.jpg Clock Tower Surrounded by high walls, the Clock Tower and Culture Center behind it mark another point where shorter-ranged Loadouts can perform well. The entry points from the Caf\u00e9 to the west, Main Street to the south, and Apartment to the east present some risk when holding these positions, but the area\u2019s central location gives Operators a chance to cut off a major thoroughfare through the map. Lock down this spot and enemies will be forced into crossing Main Street. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/af7f92f1dbb92991fd27e7265b0a9ca15e7e13cc.jpg Shops The Shops form a key area around the western section of Main Street, providing access to several interior spaces. The Caf\u00e9 and Main Store are great starting points for an attack toward the Clock Tower, with the upper Main Store additionally looking deep into Hill. The Restaurant on the area\u2019s southern border offers a large ground-floor interior; hop onto the walls surrounding its outdoor seating for a raised view over the Shops. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/23b7d604c083ff535a4bffbc590856e3c1d7fcdf.jpg Main Street A sniper\u2019s paradise, Main Street stretches nearly all the way across the map. Located in the center, it\u2019s also a major crossing point. If you need to get through, take a moment to read the area and then race across using Tactical Sprint. Expect Operators to occupy the buildings on its perimeter, namely the Main Store on its west end, the Electronics Store on its east end, and the Hotel along the bottom. Expect fighting from building to building, with Operators in the street getting caught in the middle. Sandbags, barricades, and other obstacles offer some cover in the street, but you\u2019ll still be highly exposed from multiple angles. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/b363c6a0c434acfb66f6c8165e949a32347b326a.jpg Hill While not quite as concealed as the Junkyard main spawn, the Hill sits relatively apart from the rest of the map, at least when pulling back behind Thorley\u2019s Supermarket. Note that, for this version of Strike, a new hallway was added for better combat flow, ensuring that an Operator that holes up in the Supermarket can still be smoked out through this hallway. When looking north, long-ranged Loadouts can get some shots on enemies in the Main Store and even out to the Shops. Note the balcony of the orange building here \u2014 this provides a good vantage point against enemies moving between Hill and the Flower Shop just east. And watch for Shotguns when traversing the tight staircase connecting Hill and Restaurant. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/8a25ee80e1223bb63bc422c004e415389710040c.jpg Flower Shop The Flower Shop provides a strong power position over activity in the southeast, with its upper level offering views toward Hill, over the Market, and a small section of the eastern Main Street. From the ground floor, its single front entrance provides a more concealed view against enemies coming in from the north. The gas station just east is also worth mentioning; while you can\u2019t get inside of it, the low stone wall and barricade offer solid protection when skirmishing in the area. Objective Routes and Rotations {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/8ecb4f2e665f23a6471f8bd94d4f48c3b33042b0.jpg Mode Intel: Domination Main Street heats up even more in Domination, with all three flags positioned just out of sight of the main drag. In the west, the A flag sits within the Restaurant\u2019s outdoor seating area, surrounded by high walls. It\u2019s a short trek from here to the B flag at the base of the Clock Tower, but the deadly Main Street separates the two. Positioned in the eastern Market, the C flag presents a longer travel time to B, but it\u2019s possible to move between the two flags without crossing Main Street. The team that can hold down the Clock Tower is in the best position to win, even if that means swapping between A and C as your second flag; because the area is relatively protected, it\u2019s not as difficult a task as capturing B in other maps. Mode Intel: Search & Destroy It\u2019s a long route to the bomb sites on this large map, with the attacking team starting in the southern Hill, the A site positioned by the Cultural Center behind the Clock Tower, and the B site in the eastern Market just behind the Apartment. The defending team therefore has ample time to get into position, so take it slow and communicate. Thankfully, because both sites are north of Main Street, attackers can avoid the danger there by quickly crossing over at the start of the match. Moving east from Shops is also a solid strategy, as well as booking it to the Flower Shop and then working your way up to the B site. On defense, the Apartment offers an obvious power position over B, so it may be wise to send the bulk of your forces to the A site until you have a better idea of where the attackers are heading. And don\u2019t hesitate to fan out, as this provides the team a greater overall field of view. Mode Intel: Hardpoint There are six total Hardpoints on Strike, making this a great mode for learning all the ins and outs of the map. Teams will first rush to the center with the initial Hardpoint appearing inside the Hotel before moving just west outside the Restaurant; bulk up your forces between these two areas to increase your chances of getting the most points out of both objectives. From the Restaurant, the objective moves to the Electronics Store on the other side of Main Street, then south to the Flower Shop. As with the first two Hardpoints, sending the bulk of your forces between the third and fourth objectives can help you form an early lead in the match. From the Flower Shop, teams will need to cross the map for the fifth Hardpoint by the Cultural Center; get some Operators there early since it\u2019s a long trip. The final Hardpoint appears in the primary room of the upstairs Apartment. On a larger map like this, early rotations are crucial, so play aggressively. Top Tips {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/300f6872a1658d2edbae5a1e6b12878dd4c23565.jpg 1. Learn the layout. With large buildings around every corner, you might at first feel like you can\u2019t move a step without being spotted from some balcony. That\u2019s not the case, however, as many of the buildings are closed off or only accessible on the ground floor. Take your time learning where the real threats are so you can ignore the rest. 2. Know your power positions. Once you\u2019ve identified the traversable buildings, it\u2019s time to lock in on the major power positions so that you know where to look when passing through. Get to know the Flower Shop, Apartment, and Main Store, and don\u2019t neglect power positions located on the ground floor in places like the Hotel and Electronics Store. 3. Up in smoke. Enemy snipers clogging up Main Street? Equip a Smoke Grenade so you can obstruct their view when you need to pass. Pair it with the Drill Charge to blast enemies inside buildings and behind the walls by the Clock Tower and Restaurant. 4. Found you. On larger maps like Strike, it can be more difficult to pinpoint the enemy\u2019s location. Use the Spotter Bonus Perk to check for fortified positions around the map, particularly within and around the main traversable buildings. 5. Special delivery. Can\u2019t seem to dislodge the enemy Operator holed up in the Apartment or get close to that deadly sniper on Main Street? Use the Bomb Drone Killstreak to send them an explosive gift. It\u2019s cheap and it gets the job done. 6. Pick up weapons. On bigger maps, there\u2019s often a greater chance of running through your ammo reserves. Expand your supply by picking up weapons on the ground as you move through the map. 7. Easy Care Packages. Fall back to the Junkyard or Hill for an easy Care Package deployment. While the enemy is fighting for control over Main Street, you\u2019ll be safely acquiring your next streak. 8. Birdseye. Use the Birdseye Ultimate Perk for a better view of the minimap, making it more difficult for enemies to catch you unaware on a flank. Pair it with the UAV and/or Portable Radar Field Upgrade to reveal the enemy\u2019s direction on each ping. 9. Tactical Insertion. Take control of your next spawn by placing a Tactical Insertion, an especially useful item when you need to hold down a specific area of the map. 10. Buddy system. Traverse the map with a friend to better your odds against enemy encounters. The loser of each skirmish has quite a trek back to their position. Stay frosty. \u00a9 2023 Activision Publishing, Inc.
