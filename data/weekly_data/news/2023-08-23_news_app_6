                "contents": "It's been too quiet here! While we were heads down working on the game, that doesn't mean there hasn't been anything to share. The big news: We have shown off a first public demo at a few local events. You can find bootleg videos of it around the net. The team is going hard to get the full game ready for summer 2023. The rest of this year is all about bringing the main bulk of the game to completion, start to finish. Which leaves next year to tie up lose ends, side missions, localisation, polish, publishing and more. It's a tight schedule! So let's take a look at something we've shown off in more detail with demo:The way you move around in Bomb Rush Cyberfunk! The game first started with only on foot action. But it has now grown to include skateboards, BMX and inline skates (read more about it from Dion Koster) : With those new styles there are also changes to how they all work together. You won't be grinding on your shoes in this game.Instead you automatically switch to your current set of wheels on hitting a grind (or half pipe!). And trying to ride up stairs will bring you back on your feet. But you can also swap between the two at the press of a button! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38357402/fe20be8d7961985e26506fe2f7d8157bd72254ad.gifSo what sets wheels and feet apart besides different tricks and speed? Why would you still bother to walk? Well, well! You can slide while on foot. This is the only way to gain speed from boost lanes or passing under low gaps! And there is a special high jump available when you are not on wheels. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38357402/97899035286931446dffec2568812250a08cab8c.gif{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38357402/cb2e50e21eec6c789927d27e0e5f84b81af7d7b4.gifEach type of wheels also has something unique to them. The skateboard for example is the only movestyle that can use a natas spin like this: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38357402/4e3927918307c85ad153e58c82745cd92f5df619.gifOn to tricks and combos! After you've covered another crews turf with your graffiti, you get to contest them on it in a score challenge. So how does the scoring system work?Let's start with the buttons. How many trick buttons do you need? One? That's not enough. We are giving you three! Each one has a dedicated trick tied to it, for full control over your combo chains. Three tricks on the ground. Three tricks in the air. Three tricks on a grind. The more you mix it up, the better your score. Not enough? There are also special boost tricks for each situation that reward more points. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38357402/c4546db4e4b077ee6f50bed51df75b079b39e205.gifTricks will form a combo as long as you keep the chain going. You can extend them further by landing with a slide or manual. If you are coming from higher ground, this will also give you extra speed. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38357402/14e0ae073d2ad6a75aea57d81c192127264f20b0.gifThe next part is how you turn a combo into a real high score: the Multiplier. You can run or ride on billboards and lean into hard corners on a grind. Every new billboard or hard corner you hit during a combo will increase your multiplier by one. The more of them you can find and string into a single combo, the higher your score will be.{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38357402/54278a9c2dbc139cd7e04097ce13eb2775ba9cf3.gif You got all that? Good. Until next time. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/38357402/d4f8e466305b7ee5c5c2dda5445356ab8d626ae6.gif",
