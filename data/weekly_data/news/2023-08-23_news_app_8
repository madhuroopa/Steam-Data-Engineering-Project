Welcome to Operation 627, the first mission of the Modern Warfare\u00ae III Campaign: Developed by Sledgehammer Games in partnership with Infinity Ward, the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III Campaign is the direct sequel to the events of Modern Warfare II. As mentioned in the full game\u2019s Announcement, this Campaign features a seamless integration of missions built around Call of Duty\u2019s signature, cinematic moments that have defined two decades of the franchise\u2019s action-packed, narrative-driven, single-player experiences, and brand-new Open Combat Missions designed to give the player freedom to approach the action in a variety of different ways. The full Campaign, of course, is available up to one week prior to the game\u2019s official launch on November 10, and is available through Campaign Early Access, included in all digital pre-order editions of Modern Warfare III (*1). \u00a0One week based on estimated access; actual play time subject to possible outages and applicable time zone differences. Prepare for uneasy alliances and unfinished business: To save a world on the brink of war, the time has come to confront your past: Operation 627, A Breakdown {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/7abd7bf3f332f6f3a03b8ff853531a213e36a0d8.jpg As revealed earlier today, the first mission in the Modern Warfare III Campaign is \u201cOperation 627,\u201d a traditional cinematic experience that introduces the next chapter of the Modern Warfare universe. In this prelude, an elite PMC fireteam \u2013 \u201cAlpha Team\u201d \u2013 invades a stone fortress in an area that Call of Duty veterans know all too well: Verdansk. While familiar, Verdansk will be seen from a new perspective in Modern Warfare III\u2019s Campaign: in the year 2023, a new threat completely locked down this capital of Kastovia. Those who watched the Modern Warfare III\u2019s Worldwide Reveal Trailer and the Makarov Reveal Trailer might recognize momentary flashes of this mission \u2013 now it\u2019s time to dive deeper into \u201cOperation 627\u201d: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/93339f46f3d9fd7833d920a88416a22652256143.jpg On October 13, 2023, at 0200 hours (2 AM) local time, Alpha Team successfully infiltrates the Zordaya Prison Complex via amphibious tactics, using water suits, oxygen tanks, and diver propulsion vehicles to reach the complex\u2019s base. After ascending the battlements\u2019 slope, the team follows the mission\u2019s optimal plans, using suppressed weapons, night-vision goggles (NVGs), and stealth tactics to move along the wallwalk until they find a breach in its western section. Alongside parachuting reinforcements, Alpha Team moves into position down off the battlements and onto the courtyard level, confirming visual on an HVT entering a prisoner transfer helicopter\u2026 But it\u2019s not \u201cour guy.\u201d Because \u201cour guy\u201d is deeper in the complex, Alpha Team calls in a distraction play, using an explosive outside the facility to get the first strike from behind on enemy forces. Quickly losing its low profile, Alpha Team uses a smokescreen for cover before finding a hatch in the courtyard, which they then use to descend further into the complex via its intricate tunnel network. Fortunately, they land right near the heart of the panopticon, the gulag\u2019s proper prison with a central security observatory tower, which Alpha Team sees moments before they radio in for total darkness. With only muzzle flashes, lasers, and their NVGs as their only sources for light, Alpha Team methodically rappels down the interior spine of the prison, instigating a successful prison riot by downing several prison guards who desperately try to re-establish order. The cell gates unlock, and the inmates barge out and into the curved corridors, intent on revenge, as klaxons blare and confusion reigns. Alpha Team eventually reaches the prison\u2019s lowest level. As locked inmates cheer and clank their cell bars in support, Alpha Team eliminates several more guards and reaches the sub-level to \u201cget our guy.\u201d A sealed interior door is breached with explosives\u2026 And the rest\u2026 Well, you\u2019ll have to wait until Campaign Early Access (*1) for that part of the story. Tomorrow\u2019s Intel Drop: Open Combat Missions In addition to \u201cOperation 627\u201d and other cinematic missions, Modern Warfare III\u2019s Campaign seamlessly integrates more freeform single-player experiences into the mission structure. These are known as Open Combat Missions. Expect a detailed overview of this innovation here on the Call of Duty Blog, tomorrow on August 23.

                "contents": "For the first time in back-to-back years, Call of Duty returns with a direct sequel as Call of Duty\u00ae: Modern Warfare\u00ae III picks up immediately following the events of last year's incredible blockbuster Call of Duty\u00ae: Modern Warfare\u00ae II. This all-new experience is scheduled to be released worldwide on Friday, November 10th allowing players for the first time to continue their journey, progression, and story seamlessly for a new year to come. Get ready for an all-new Campaign that continues the story immediately following the events of Modern Warfare II. Lead developer Sledgehammer Games, in partnership with Infinity Ward is set to deliver a full Campaign of action-packed operations ranging from signature, cinematic experiences to free-form Open Combat Missions, resulting in more player choice than ever before. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/fa870a6558c1865bc1d0d66f38cef5b1467fdd49.jpg Expect a world-class Multiplayer experience celebrating the Modern Warfare series\u2019 greatest legacies; all 16 launch maps from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) have been modernized with new modes and gameplay features and will be available at launch to get everyone started, while over 12 all-new core 6v6 maps will fuel post-launch live seasons. For the first time, team up with other squads to survive and fight massive hordes of the undead in the largest Call of Duty Zombies map ever. Modern Warfare Zombies (MWZ) tells a new Zombies story from developer Treyarch, with missions, core Zombies features, and a host of secrets to discover. Campaign: Adapt or Die in a Fight Against the Ultimate Threat In the direct sequel to the record-breaking Modern Warfare II, Captain Price, and Task Force 141 face off against the ultimate threat. The ultranationalist Vladimir Makarov is extending his grasp across the world, causing Task Force 141 to fight like never before. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/2cfb2a8e8b8fb3384741e7be4352fc2a3abcae5b.jpg Combat means making decisions; using different Loadouts and planning different paths through every operation across an involved and thrilling Campaign. In addition to the signature, cinematic Call of Duty missions, Modern Warfare III introduces Open Combat Missions, with even greater emphasis on player choice. Naturally, you\u2019ll have the use of all the weapons, equipment, and tactics present in an action-packed Modern Warfare single-player experience, but for some of your engagements, it is completely up to you to decide on an appropriate course of action. Open Combat Missions Open Combat Missions (OCMs) are an exciting innovation to the Call of Duty Campaign. Not only do these complement the cinematic missions you\u2019ve come to expect, but they also provide you with numerous additional choices regarding your methods of mission completion. For example, if you prefer to use stealth techniques, you may wish to undertake an OCM with a lights-out approach, using night-vision goggles and suppressed weapons and complete your objectives without your adversaries knowing you were even there. However, if loud explosions and reckless abandon are part of your repertoire, strap extra armor plates onto your torso and hit those targets head-on! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/3f08de614f9815ec848e7eeff7e95fd2938c6f67.jpg Feel free to take advantage of any operable vehicles within your area of operations. You\u2019re able to experiment with and leverage tactical and lethal equipment. You have the flexibility to maneuver across the sizable landscape of a mission\u2019s AO and approach objectives from multiple angles. You can truly play how you want to play, and Open Combat Missions will support it. Multiplayer: It\u2019s Time to Settle Old Scores and Start New Ones Modern Warfare III celebrates the 20th anniversary of Call of Duty with one of the greatest collections of Modern Warfare Multiplayer maps ever assembled. Legendary Core Maps. Modern Gameplay. Afghan. Derail. Estate. Favela. Karachi. Highrise. Invasion. Quarry. Rundown. Rust. Scrapyard. Skidrow. Sub Base. Terminal. Underpass. Wasteland. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/bcb959016045ccd4b747d497b24f06a371fc14a8.jpg All 16 launch maps from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) have been modernized, both graphically and with meticulous attention given to the authenticity and aspects of the maps that made them so popular. Veteran players love these Core 6v6 maps, and there\u2019s no better time to introduce a generation of new players to experience the community\u2019s favorite Modern Warfare content. Prepare for seminal design to meet modern gameplay. This faithful modernization of the maps keeps their authenticity intact while infusing the latest tech, gameplay, modes, content, and more. Though you might have noticed elements of Terminal and Highrise during your time in Al Mazrah, the Modern Warfare III versions of these maps are built from scratch from the original 2009 designs. In addition to brand-new modes like Cutthroat (a competitive 3v3v3 experience), a full range of fan-favorite and innovative gameplay features will be available at launch to get everyone started, like choosing to play Hardpoint and Kill Confirmed on Favela, modes that were never part of the original map offering, providing a refreshing multiplayer experience within these familiar environments. Going Big with Brand-New Maps. Ground War and War Modes Return! The 16 Core launch maps are further complemented with the addition of four huge environments ready at launch and containing a host of new play spaces. These are composed of three brand-new Battle Maps \u2014 large scale locations where Modern Warfare III\u2019s Ground War and Invasion game modes will be fought \u2014 and a single, colossal War map, as Modern Warfare III marks the welcome return and evolution of the legendary War Mode that first debuted in 2017\u2019s Call of Duty\u00ae: WWII. All-New Core Map Content Comes to Live Season Content With Day One Multiplayer content featuring faithful modernizations of Modern Warfare\u2019s fan-favorite maps, over 12 all-new core 6v6 maps will fuel post-launch live seasons. Multiplayer Features: New Mechanics and Robust Customization Expect many customization advancements and new gameplay mechanics to further evolve the quintessential, fast-moving gameplay. Here are three innovations, with more to be revealed in the coming weeks: {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/41af0d3ffc9bfddb0b405823e1044b2cc5c52fd3.jpg New Gameplay Innovation: Tac-Stance Breach and clear with the new Tactical Stance feature, a perfect middle-ground between hip-fire and aiming down sights. When entering tight hallways and cramped rooms, toggle Tac-Stance on to improve weapon performance and win the fight. Here\u2019s what to expect from Tac-Stance: The operator unshoulders the weapon and holds it in a canted firing position. You can toggle in and out of Tac-Stance dynamically while aiming down sights. Tac-Stance trades precise accuracy for improved mobility and handling. Some spread to your firing will occur, best described as a middle ground between full ADS and hipfire. It is designed to be used in aggressive, close-quarter combat situations. By default, you fire in Tac-Stance while Sliding. New Gameplay Innovation: Evolving Loadouts Modern Warfare III brings new levels of customization to Create-a-Class. Get ready to build your Loadout based on cutting-edge military equipment, such as gloves, tactical vests, boots and more; allowing you to fine-tune more aspects of gameplay. New Gameplay Innovation: After-Market Parts The evolution of the Gunsmith continues with the addition of After-Market Parts. This is a special set of customization options allowing you to focus on your preferred and specific playstyle. After-Market Parts enable you to construct unique weapon configurations or types such as customizing a machine gun into a bullpup configuration (with the firing grip in front of the breech rather than behind it), thus increasing mobility and handling without compromising on damage output. After-Market Parts will also offer new progression paths, and challenges to unlock. We will be sharing more information on these innovations in the coming weeks. Multiplayer Features: Changes to Core Mechanics The core mechanics of Modern Warfare III deliver a massive offering of classic features bringing exceptional freedom of choice, movement, and customization to gameplay. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/3b8f0c132fec3b20ef681de9fc65f15f78231595.jpg The Return of Classic Gameplay Here are the Multiplayer features confirmed for Modern Warfare III Multiplayer, coming Day One: Map Voting returns, allowing players greater autonomy over their Multiplayer matches. Classic Minimap Behavior, with red dots indicating when an enemy is firing an unsuppressed weapon. All chosen Perks are available at the start of each match. The Covert Sneakers Perk allows for silent movement (assuming you\u2019ve chosen the correct footwear). Core Multiplayer Health is increased to 150, lengthening the Time-to-Kill (TTK). Hardcore mode is not affected. Movement in Modern Warfare III: Responsiveness When maneuvering in Modern Warfare III Multiplayer, expect the following movement abilities in terms of your Operator\u2019s general responsiveness: You can cancel Slide animations (i.e., \u201cslide cancel\u201d), but Slide Cancelling does not reset Tactical Sprint. You can cancel partial Reloads during an animation (i.e., \u201creload cancel\u201d) to immediately return fire. Mantling is faster, and you can Mantle while Sprinting. You can fire during and immediately after Sliding. Tactical Sprint durations are increased (the exact duration depends on the weapon being used). Tactical Sprint recharges while Sprinting. Multiplayer Features: Carry Forward Campaign screenshot shown. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/5f6bd34e7f9e05bc94b47a8b59f644988c283a37.jpg As discussed in the Carry Forward Deep Dive Q&A Blog, a vast amount of content and weapon progression from Modern Warfare II will come with you to Modern Warfare III. That means every Multiplayer weapon you currently have in your MWII arsenal, along with all the new weapons available in Modern Warfare III, will be accessible to use on Day One. The depth of choice here truly honors the player investment into Modern Warfare II. All MWII weapons, attachments, and unlocks will Carry Forward. There will be seamless functionality between new attachments and global Weapon Platforms. Any MWII attachments that were considered \u201cuniversal\u201d (such as some Muzzles) will be available to attach to MWIII weapons, where applicable. In certain cases, MWII weapons carried forward into MWIII will be able to utilize MWIII attachments that you unlock, where applicable. The number of Weapon Platforms (AKA \u201cReceivers\u201d) have been increased for some categories, reducing restrictions on weapon customization by allowing for core attachments to be added to your favorite MWII weapons. Zombies: An All-New, Open World {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/2c87d44cd5128faa7446255705e8ac868b954ab6.jpg For the first time, team up with other squads to survive and fight massive hordes of the undead in the largest Call of Duty Zombies map ever.

Shadow Company, in alignment with Urzikstan Liberation Force and its leaders Farah Karim and Alex Keller, has actionable intel on a dangerous arsenal hidden underneath Al Mazrah\u2019s Zaya Observatory.

As we see in the Season 05 opening cinematic, Farah and Alex are working with Shadow Company and its CEO, Graves. Yes, he\u2019s alive, and the narrative about his whereabouts were so well covered by his cyber commander Oz, that Operators like Alex questioned whether he \u201cperished\u201d Las Almas or somewhere else in Central or South America. Meanwhile in DMZ, an unidentified military force funded by local philanthropist Milena Romonova invades Vondel. As Laswell partners with Phalanx and Black Mous PMC Groups to discover this military force\u2019s true identity, the Crown Faction ramped up recruitment efforts and offered lucrative payouts for Operators that secured nuclear fuel rods. As it turned out, the unidentified military group and the Crown were one in the same: They were both Konni. All of that, including the false flag operation in Vondel that saw its Train Station and Police Station attacked, allowed Konni to move into Al Mazrah. In DMZ, Shadow Company agents are fighting side-by-side with Operators (unless there is friendly fire) against Konni. During the past few weeks, DMZ Operators also uncovered key Notes in the Koschei Complex linking Kochei and other threats together as one ultranationalist threat\u2026 And that is not even mentioning Valeria breaking out of her Las Almas prison, invading Al Mazrah Port, and expanding their smuggling operations. That all leads up to today: the start of Shadow Siege with Operation: Rogue Arsenal. Operation: Rogue Arsenal Mission Details {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/67d2b6afce5bf27ab8ffc64b3b06a745f62d596e.jpg At the beginning of the Shadow Siege event, up to 32 Operators will receive a briefing from Commander Phillip Graves. Listen up; Graves only has time to detail key intel and mission objectives once, and this information is critical to the mission\u2019s success. It\u2019s your loss if you decide to tune out the Shadow Company CEO. NOTE: Due to the severity of this mission, we recommended squading up in Quads. Be sure to bring three allies to the fight with you or use Squad Fill to complete your Quad. For those requiring step-by-step clarity, Shadow Siege is as follows: First, everyone is on the same team for this Operation; all Operators will battle against Konni Group AI Combatants. Shadow Company provides a Durable Gas Mask and a Self-Revive Kit to go alongside your Custom Loadout. Furthermore, respawns are enabled. However, if you go down, it\u2019s best to get revived by a squadmate, as that\u2019s a faster way to get back into the fight rather than having to parachute back in. Phase I: Secure One of Eight Missile Launchers After dropping out of the infiltration plane, Operators must secure one of eight missile launchers around Al Mazrah with their squad. These launchers can be located on your in-game Tac Map and via missile icons in the overworld. Once all missile launchers are secured, the Zaya Observatory is bombarded with missiles, changing Al Mazrah forever. This is also when Phase II of the Operation begins. Phase II: Collect Gas Canisters After the target \u2014 an underground weapons facility for manufacturing chemical weaponry \u2014 is revealed underneath the Zaya Observatory, all Operators must collect 45 gas canisters combined across all squads. The second you collect a gas canister, your perspective will shift from first to third person until the canister is deposited at a helicopter transport vehicle outside the facility. Once you have a canister, the helicopter transport is clearly marked on your Tac Map, as well as within the overworld, with an icon of said vehicle. Because the arsenal contains chemical weapons, every Operator has a Durable Gas Mask for safety. The Tac Map shows the area (in yellow) where there is too much chemical radiation for an Operator to handle without a Gas Mask, just like a Circle Collapse in other modes. Be prepared to frequently replace Gas Masks while inside the facility; open Supply Boxes, grab them off dead enemy agents, or look to the exfil chopper to find more Gas Masks \u2014 this is vital to your Operator\u2019s health. Expect some hard-hitting enemies to be stationed in, around, and above the Observatory complex as you battle your way to the chemical weapons arsenal and attempt to extract those gas canisters. Along the way, Operators may face Commanders in the air (attack helicopters) as well as on the ground (Wheelsons and Juggernauts). These are highly dangerous enemies compared to the regular Konni Group, but it\u2019s vital to engage them if you\u2019re intent on earning the new M13C Base Weapon reward. While moving through the underground facility, Konni agents may drop their Burner Phones. Keep your head on a swivel to intercept enemy communications\u2026 And maybe figure out why they are here defending this lab underneath Al Mazrah. Phase III: Exfil The second that 45th canister is collected, all Operators must find the exfil location (the icon is the same as the Exfil Chopper icon in DMZ) to leave Al Mazrah immediately. At this time, the gas (a green circle on the Tac Map) will explode outwards from the facility. It is possible to get left behind if you don\u2019t reach the Exfil Chopper before it leaves \u2014 keep that in mind when trying to complete all reward objectives for Shadow Siege. Whether you reach the Exfil Chopper or not, the ultimate threat is revealed\u2026 In participating with Shadow Siege, you become the first to learn Konni\u2019s true agenda, as well as see the Worldwide Reveal Trailer for Modern Warfare III. Note \u2013 Operation: Rogue Arsenal is replayable until its planned removal from the Call of Duty: Warzone playlist rotation on August 21 at 10:30 A.M. PT. Operation: Rogue Arsenal Rewards {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/cd8478bd68e66fe188958d7cb9c3e6a2188ba133.jpg All Operators will receive the following rewards for completing specific challenges within the Shadow Siege event: \u201cSerpent Slayer\" Vehicle Skin - Secure a Missile Launcher \"Konni Group\" Emblem - Blow up the Observatory \"Crimson Sound\" Calling Card - Exfil with a mission success \"Gas Canister\" Charm - Deliver multiple Gas Canisters as a Squad in a single deployment 1 Battle Token Tier Skip - Intercept 5 radio transmissions \"M13C\" Assault Rifle (New Weapon)*** - Assist in killing 5 Commanders \u2013 NOTE: Juggernauts, Boss Choppers, and Wheelsons all count towards this challenge All these rewards are immediately available in Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare II.

Operation: Rogue Arsenal Final Tips {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/f38a15626690717dc23124ec9c1ce63d19120443.jpg The Shadow Siege event is something for you to experience for yourself, especially with all the rewards you can earn. With that in mind, here are some tips for playing this experience and earning all rewards: 1. Move as one. A squad that sticks together \u2014 including when eliminating enemies and taking on objectives \u2014 wins together. Everyone in a four-person squad will receive rewards if at least one squad member completes objectives and if all squad members complete the match. Move as one unit throughout Shadow Siege to accomplish the mission and earn all its rewards. 2. Remember the reward objectives. If it means putting this blog post on a second screen (e.g., a spare monitor or a phone) or writing down the reward objectives, do so. Along with looking at the in-game objectives that appear under the minimap, remember all six of the objectives tied to rewards. Even if you played this Operation once, keep replaying it to unlock all six rewards; there might not be many opportunities in the future to earn them again (outside of the M13C). 3. The first mile to success. Vehicles are paramount to a quick and successful run of Operation: Rogue Arsenal. It\u2019s quicker to reach the missile silos or Observatory via vehicle \u2013 the MRAP and Helicopter, for example \u2014 compared to on foot. It\u2019s also possible to drive the Dirt Bikes and ATVs through the bunkers as well. 4. Commanders are no pushovers. If you play DMZ, you know the tactical prowess it takes to neutralize a Commander head-on. Be creative and ensure you have the right tools for the job \u2014 weapons, equipment, and other items \u2014 to dispatch these deadly foes. 5. Reap the rewards. All rewards carry over into Modern Warfare III (including what you get in the Battle Token Tier Skip, which will be applied to the Season 05 Battle Pass). Start leveling up that M13C \u2014 we recommend it for stealth missions and pairing it with stealth-based Perks and other Loadout Items \u2014 and get it maxed out (or even Gold, Platinum, Polyatomic or Orion) before bringing it into a new fight starting on November 10.
