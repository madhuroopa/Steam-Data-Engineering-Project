                "contents": "Yesterday sucked. There is no other way to say it. It sucked for people who purchased Founder\u2019s Packs and couldn\u2019t play, and it sucked for us to see players unable to get into the game after believing in us and our vision. Early Access isn\u2019t a crutch. It\u2019s a conversation between a studio and the community that\u2019s helping build the game alongside the studio. We said from the start that we\u2019d be transparent and open with the community and that continues now that we have players entrusting us with their money, and us failing to deliver. SERVERS AND LOGIN Although we ran technical tests and betas across multiple regions, we were seeing more players every minute than played in our Beta each day. Although we had a queue system ready, that system failed immediately. We quickly implemented numerous fixes to try and stabilize the login experience and those failed as well. We ended up having to put a cap on the players that were on the server which was less than ideal and resulted in the \"Maximum Player Limit Reached\u201d error last night. UPDATE FROM DIGITAL EXTREMES At early access launch, severe server/login issues led to many players not being able to connect or play. We know and value your trust and apologize for the shaky beginning: as players ourselves we know the disappointment many are feeling. We apologize - we know players have high expectations of DE\u2019s infrastructure to deliver in moments like this, and in this instance we, as the publisher, fell short. We\u2019re committed to ensuring long term stability through the early access period. We are thankful for the enthusiasm and interest of our community and for your continued patience as we close in on a permanent solution.\u201d We realize that buying something and not being able to actually login and play frankly is a bad look. One solution we heard often was that we should have offered pre-sales to gauge interest. Unfortunately, some 1st party stores do not offer pre-sales of Early Access and we were unable to meet demand. Currently the game\u2019s login queue is functioning. Sitting in a queue isn\u2019t actually being in-game and playing, but it\u2019s allowing a trickle of players in as we continue to up capacity across all regions and that has been successful. We\u2019ll continue to make optimizations to the queue and servers in the coming days and weeks until all players are in and playing. FOUNDER\u2019S PACKS ISSUES We are also aware that a small portion of players did not get their Founder\u2019s Pack items. We are aware of this issue and although it affects a small portion of players, it\u2019s a priority to make sure that our Founders get their items. A lot of the missing items are related to the back end server issues and unfortunately we can\u2019t provide a better update right now until we have more stability. Again, Founder\u2019s Packs are you entrusting us, and we didn\u2019t deliver. Please contact support at https://playwayfinder.zendesk.com/ at this time so we can collect your information as we work towards a solution. MONETIZATION We also saw conversation around some of our bundle prices being just shy of items in our store. We agree that it\u2019s not player friendly. We\u2019re revisiting this pricing so that they are 1,000 Runesilver, and will retroactively grant the difference for anyone that has paid for any of these weapons. PLAYER COMPENSATION Players lost valuable time waiting to get into the game or taking days off to play. That sucks. We\u2019re currently working on our plans for compensating those purchased into Early Access whether they got into the game or not. Yesterday proved that Wayfinder has an audience, but we must take action to meet the demand that audience deserves. First and foremost, that involves us fortifying our underlying platform and technology to deliver our vision for an online world for friends. It\u2019s about winning back our player\u2019s trust through actions and not words, and it\u2019s about getting the game into a playable state for all.",

                "contents": "The recent Global Closed Beta brought in the largest number of players we've seen yet. It was truly incredible to see so many Wayfinders curious to explore Evenor and provide constructive input! Each playtest has been instrumental for us to enhance and improve Wayfinder, all because of your feedback. It\u2019s tough to imagine what Wayfinder would look like without our remarkable community supporting us every step of the way, and we cannot thank each of you enough. Here are just a few numbers from the Global Closed Beta: 183,691 Hunts completed with Bosses slain 13,600,000 Enemies killed (with 852,000 Baby Spiders being squashed) 415,000 Expeditions into Lost Zones completed Global Closed Beta Takeaways and Next Steps While we\u2019ve fixed close to 2,000 bugs since that test, we\u2019ve also been hard at work adding things based on your feedback into the game so it\u2019s ready for when we hit Early Access this summer! Combat Movement As cool as sliding past your enemies without a care in Evenor looks, sometimes that\u2019s not the intention. We\u2019re disabling forward movement if the target is in active hit range to avoid overstepping and sliding past them. This will prevent players from directly intersecting with enemies less often, with the added benefit of improved visibility. Targeting Stick to your intended target! We\u2019re fixing a targeting issue with all weapons that was most felt when using two-handed weapons. Sometimes in combat, players would slide attack, but move past their intended targets and frequently switch targets. We\u2019re making changes that will allow players to stick to their desired target more consistently as well as making lock-on camera improvements. Additionally we\u2019re fixing a bug where dead enemies would remain a viable target unintentionally and could cause players to remain targeted on the dead enemy and keep sliding past their intended target. Defensive Maneuvers Previously, players could only parry, block and dodge at specific frames during melee attacks, and understandably that didn\u2019t feel great when reacting to enemy attacks. We\u2019re improving the interrupt windows significantly so players can parry, dodge and block at any frame during melee combat to improve flexibility and responsiveness. We\u2019re also working on standardizing the attack warnings to make it easier to correctly time interrupts across all enemy types. Short and Long Term Progression In Wayfinder we want you to feel like you\u2019re always progressing and getting stronger in the world. One thing we heard loud and clear from players is they want the ability to pick and choose the order of their abilities to unlock, so we\u2019re making that change right away. Additionally, while we have a lot of systems in place for progression, one that we think needs clearer goals for players is long term progression. We don\u2019t want you to feel like you're missing out when not playing your \u201cmain\u201d character or favorite weapon, so we\u2019re folding in some of our planned systems for character progression and implementing them on an account level. This means more meaningful long term progression beyond small stat boosts into full blown abilities and power-ups you can earn at the account level via \u201cArchetype\u201d and \u201cArmory\u201d level progression systems. We\u2019ll have more on this later! Echoes The Echo system is something that we love about Wayfinder and while feedback from players has been positive, it\u2019s clear that it can be confusing at times. We\u2019re going to be simplifying Echos by organizing them into clear categories such as attack, defense, etc. We\u2019re also going to introduce a broader range of Echoes that are not just \u201cstat sticks\u201d and allow for even more diverse builds. Enemies and Enemy Variance With millions of enemies felled in the last beta, we received a ton of data and feedback to pour over. What we found is that encounters with our broad range of enemies need more variance. For example, a small monster could have the same time to kill as a much larger mini boss you\u2019d find in a Lost Zone event. We\u2019re going to be addressing this by having a bit more variance in enemy encounters: players should expect to find weaker, swarming enemies alongside more powerful foes. This should improve the dynamics of gameplay and make for an even more engaging experience. Social Systems At its heart, Wayfinder is a social game. We heard a lot about the limitations to in-game chat and we\u2019re implementing a series of quality of life improvements to our entire chat system. First and foremost, you\u2019ll be placed in your region\u2019s chat by default so you can better coordinate a Lost Zone expedition or just compliment someone on their dye choice. Global chat will still be there, but won\u2019t be what everyone sees upon logging in. We also are enabling localized chats. This means that if the system detects your language as Brazilian Portuguese, you\u2019ll be in with other players who speak that language. You can also opt into a language if it\u2019s not selected by default. We\u2019ve also improved our spam detection across the board, and yes\u2013 you\u2019ll be able to resize the chat window so you can see the memes easier. Furthermore, we heard you loud and clear that sometimes you just want to play with your buddy... In Early Access when queued as a duo, you\u2019ll have the option to fill your party (by adding a third Wayfinder) or proceed into the unknown with just the two of you. ICYMI - Previous Improvements We were thrilled to take action and add a number of other highly-requested features and improvements prior to theGlobal Closed Beta. Some of these features included adding a spry new jump-dash as well as a movement speed increase, a complete camera system overhaul, the addition of a Material Codex, performance optimizations and more. For more details about these features you can read about them here. Wayfinder\u2019s Future and What\u2019s To Come While Wayfinder has gone through many changes since you first set foot in Evenor, we continue to develop the game with a vision of a long-lasting, online multiplayer action-RPG that is free and fair for all. Feedback from players like you will continue to play a vital role in Wayfinder\u2019s evolution. Don\u2019t forget to wishlist Wayfinder to be the first to know when Early Access is available this summer. We\u2019ll have information coming soon on Founder\u2019s Packs and everything you need to know to prepare, so stay tuned! https://store.steampowered.com/app/1171690/",

Eager adventurers, add Wayfinder to your Wishlist below! https://store.steampowered.com/app/1171690/Wayfinder/ Your Feedback: The Compass Guiding Wayfinder We want to thank you once again for the incredible support, feedback and participation you provided in all of our Closed Beta tests. It has been such a joy for us to welcome more and more players into the world of Evenor. For those who did not receive an invite to play in the Betas, your time will come soon! The feedback we've received has been instrumental in guiding our development journey thus far, and that\u2019s never been more true with Early Access on the horizon. Your enthusiasm for Wayfinder truly lights our way. As summer fast approaches, we're eager to share a glimpse of what lies ahead for Wayfinder. Our team has already begun implementing improvements and addressing key insights from the recent Global Closed Beta\u2019s Private Discord and our FeatureUpvote website. Combat and combat animations, ability upgrades, and in-game chat are just some of the things we are already planning on improving from last beta, and we\u2019ll be posting a full deep dive into these planned changes and more as we work towards Early Access. Stay tuned! Coming Soon: Founder\u2019s Packs Reveal! There's even more to look forward to! We're also gearing up to reveal our Founder's Packs, designed to offer a wide range of exclusive items and rewards across various Tiers, ensuring there's something for everyone.
