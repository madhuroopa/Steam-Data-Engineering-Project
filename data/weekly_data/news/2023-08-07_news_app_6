We've implemented several bug fixes and corrected visual bugs, including texture streaming issues and visible flickering of water reflections on certain settings. This patch also implements a change to improve game stability, based on data from our crash reporting system and user reports. We continue to monitor and investigate crash reports and user feedback and are actively working to improve stability with future updates. Thanks again for playing Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and for sharing your feedback. Patch Notes Resolved texture streaming issues that could result in certain textures remaining low resolution. Fixed visual issues with water reflections that occurred when ambient occlusion was set to anything other than SSAO. Resolved an issue that caused the interact button prompt to remain visible on the screen. Fixed a visual issue with weapon previews at the vendor when using ultra-wide resolutions. Various bug fixes, stability improvements and optimizations. If you experience any problems after updating to the latest version, please contact us using this link. As a workaround, you can revert to the previous version of the game.

                "contents": "Next week, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is launching on PC! Many of you have asked for details about the technologies used and system requirements. Today we are answering those questions, and on top of that, we have some exciting new feature announcements. To ensure a smooth dimension-hopping experience, our team implemented DirectStorage 1.2 in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart on PC, including GPU decompression. Richard van der Laan, Senior Lead Programmer at Nixxes Software, explains: \u201cTo enable quick loading and instant transition between dimensions, the game needs to be able to load assets quickly. DirectStorage ensures quick loading times, and GPU decompression is used at high graphics settings to stream assets in the background while playing. Traditionally, this decompression is handled by the CPU, but at a certain point, there is an advantage to letting the GPU handle this, as this enables a higher bandwidth for streaming assets from storage to the graphics card. We use this to quickly load high-quality textures and environments with a high level of detail.\u201d {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44183032/06d4c02ff8cccec9379519481f4df699fa88e991.jpg Principal Programmer Alex Bartholomeus: \u201cFor Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart on PC, we added adaptive streaming based on live measurement of the available hardware bandwidth. This allows us to tailor the texture streaming strategy for the best possible texture streaming on any configuration. With DirectStorage, the use of a fast NVMe SSD and GPU decompression, this results in very responsive texture streaming even at the highest settings.\u201d DirectStorage is developed to fully utilize the speed of fast PCIe NVMe SSDs, but the technology is also compatible with SATA SSDs and even traditional hard disk drives. This means Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart on PC can use the same technology for loading data, regardless of the storage device in your system. Ray-Traced Ambient Occlusion and XeGTAO In our initial announcement, we shared that Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart on PC will feature ray-traced reflections and newly added ray-traced shadows for natural outdoor light. Today we can reveal the addition of another option that will further enhance the realism of light in the game: Ray-Traced Ambient Occlusion, with various quality levels to choose from. Graphics Programmer Menno Bil explains: \u201cAmbient occlusion is a technique used in games to simulate how ambient lighting affects a scene. Ambient lighting is a form of indirect lighting: the light reflected from other surfaces. This effect mostly appears at creases, cracks, and corners where surfaces are close to each other. Commonly used AO techniques are SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occlusion) and HBAO+ (Horizon-Based Ambient Occlusion). These are not very demanding on the hardware, but they do not provide physically accurate results. RTAO utilizes ray tracing further to enhance the realism of ambient occlusion in the game. We have implemented RTAO as an addition for those with high-end systems with ray-tracing compatible hardware and processing power to spare.\u201d Menno and the team also implemented XeGTAO, Intel\u2019s implementation of Ground-Truth Ambient Occlusion. Like SSAO and HBAO+, this solution is based on screen space. Therefore, this technique does not enable the level of realism that RTAO does, but the performance cost is much lower and comparable to that of the HBAO+ implementation. XeGTAO is selectable as an option in the game and works with graphics cards from all vendors. \u201cXeGTAO generates a very high-resolution ambient occlusion that shows even the smallest details in geometry,\u201d says Bil. \u201cOverall, the output quality of XeGTAO is very high and results in a pleasant look.\u201d System Requirements Now that we have detailed all the features of Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart for PC, it is time to tell you more about the system requirements. When making a PC version of a game, we put a lot of work into scalability. Additions like ray-traced shadows, ray-traced ambient occlusion, and triple-screen support are aimed at those with the latest and greatest hardware so they can push their systems. With highly customizable graphics and features, we make the game scale to less powerful systems to make it accessible for as many gamers as possible. Below is an overview of the recommended specifications for a variety of graphical presets. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/44183032/f3221cac1a16a446f1dea9bfdb81822a95e36d91.jpg While Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart can be enjoyed using an HDD and the minimum system requirements, we encourage players to use an SSD in combination with the recommended system requirements or higher, to experience the game\u2019s signature dimension-hopping gameplay as originally intended. Details regarding ray-tracing support for AMD GPUs coming soon",
