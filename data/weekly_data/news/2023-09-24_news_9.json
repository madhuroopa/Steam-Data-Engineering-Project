For a long while now, the much loved but not massively successful first person shooter Titanfall 2 has been essentially impossible to play online. But, as shared in the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/16fcaxp/vanilla_titanfall2_is_confirmed_playable_also/\">Titanfall subreddit</a>, the game has had an update that appears to have fixed the game's multiplayer servers. Up until recently, matchmaking was basically impossible, and server stability was often shaky at best. This recent update has fixed those issues though, alongside adding in new and old game modes, which have been rotated in and out since the update went live. A number of other issues have been changed too, like glitches, out-of-bounds exploits, as well as some changes to the map's geometry. Most notably, though, a number of Nessie plushies, Apex Legend's mascot, that are holding hammers have been spotted across the various parts of the maps that have been tweaked, as spotted by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16jf0bo/there_is_something_going_on_with_titanfall_2/\">another user on Reddit</a>. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/titanfall-2-online-multiplayer-update\">Read more</a> ",
