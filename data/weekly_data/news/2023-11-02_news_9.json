The first Witcher game is almost comically rudimentary next to the lavishly motion captured, ray traced first-person world of Cyberpunk. But it was fun, with a fantasy setting that felt different to other RPGs I&apos;d played at the time. The graphical leap in 2011&apos;s The Witcher 2 was nothing short of stunning, and the quality of the sidequests in The Witcher 3&apos;s massive open world made CD Projekt my favorite RPG developer just four years later.

Fixed an issue where the appearance of V's hands in first-person perspective might not change correctly after installing or uninstalling arm cyberware.
