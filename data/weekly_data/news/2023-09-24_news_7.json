Obviously the biggest game to be joining Game Pass in September is <a href=\"/starfield-guide-quest-walkthroughs-item-locations-and-more\">Starfield</a>, no one's arguing against that (though it's <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/starfield-isnt-the-best-sci-fi-game-to-join-game-pass-this-month\">not necessarily the best sci-fi game</a> to join the service this month). But there are some other worthwhile titles joining the service soon, and Xbox has announced the next batch over on the <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/09/19/game-pass-september-2023-wave-2-announce/\">Xbox Wire blog</a>. First up is the Bloodborne-inspired <strong>Lies of P</strong>, a Soulslike all about Pinocchio of all characters that's available from today on cloud, console and PC. While Sherif wasn't too enthused by it in his <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/lies-of-p-review\">review</a>, if you already have Game Pass you can make your own mind up about it at the very least. Plus, it does have <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/lies-of-p-does-one-thing-every-souls-like-should\">one small quality of life update</a> that all Soulslikes should include. <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/xbox-game-pass-september-payday-3-gotham-knights\">Read more</a> ",
