OCMs redefine player agency, offering an unparalleled degree of freedom and greatly expanding the playable area. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/714c5d0ad836f77f2500d35c904f6695477bc20e.png Fixed objective, endless possibilities: You\u2019re there to complete the mission, but how you do it is up to you. Slip through like a shadow or go in loud and start blasting. Scavenge extra gear throughout the AO to suit your preferred playstyle. Seek out essential gear: While seeking out new weapons, Armor Plates, and other items, keep your eyes peeled for Ziplines and Ascenders. Often near objective locations, these items skyrocket your movement potential across the map. But they were just here: Caught off guard and outnumbered? Retreat into the environment, using your Ascender and Parachute to quickly get out of view. If the enemy loses sight of you for long enough, they will eventually stop their direct pursuit, and resort to searching the vicinity for you. Your Operator {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/514c18e6b2857ad2d40efb2a869a965e0f663055.jpg Open Combat Missions require the best of the best. In each mission, you will deploy as a designated member of Task Force 141: Farah, Ghost, Gaz, Soap, or Price. In your first playthrough of an OCM, your Operator is assigned a starting Loadout according to the mission\u2019s narrative, including the Spotter Scope to better scan the environment for enemy threats, tagging enemies, locating equipment, and discovering information about points of interest. One of your first tasks is to seek out better gear, of which there is an abundance, found throughout the area of operations. Gear Up Expect to find all sorts of useful items in OCMs, including new weapons, Equipment, Field Upgrades, and even Armaments (that Multiplayer Operators know as \u201cKillstreaks\u201d) that will boost your offensive and defensive capabilities. Of particular importance, however, are the Parachute, Ascender, and Armor Plate Carrier upgrades. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/2800a6efe49669de5b8f726949c1e7bfeb6fe574.jpg Parachute: The Parachute is a game changer, allowing you to safely jump from great heights and soar over long distances. Follow the button prompt when jumping from a high point to activate the Parachute. When you\u2019re close to landing, your Operator will automatically cut the rope and return to a standing position, or you can cut the cord manually to force a landing. Ascender: Going up! The Ascender helps you reach the highest points on the map. With this item, you can zip up ropes that lead to places in key positions throughout the environment, or ziplines to move across long horizontal distances. Use your elevated or newly-acquired position to escape a problematic situation, snipe from a distance, or, if you\u2019ve got the Parachute, reposition far from your current location. Plate Carrier Upgrade Vest: Initially, your Operator can only equip one Armor Plate at a time, a reasonable-enough defense in minor battles but lacking when the action gets hectic. Find a Plate Carrier Upgrade Vest to increase the number of Armor Plates you can equip at a time. When you first find the Vest, your carrying capacity will increase to two Armor Plates, and then three after finding another one. Now you\u2019re ready for anything. Getting Around: Your Tac Map and Minimap {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/28204aa4b74705753a9b533d461d0550e046447a.jpg Tac Map The Tac Map is of essential importance, providing an overview of the objective and its location. A legend indicates the position of important items, and a tracker shows your most important gear and the weapons and items you\u2019ve discovered in the level. When first deploying into an OCM, the majority of the Tac Map will be covered in a fog of war. As you explore the environment, the fog will be lifted, revealing greater environmental detail. Minimap Use the minimap to pinpoint items in your immediate surroundings without needing to pull up your Tac Map. Discovered weapons, Supply Boxes, Field Upgrades, and other Armaments will be displayed here along with the objective location and other points of interest. Enemy Alert Levels: The minimap is also your cue to the enemy\u2019s current alert level. When you\u2019ve been seen, the borders will turn yellow, indicating that they are aware of something in the vicinity without knowing your exact location. If found \u2014 or if you initiate the attack \u2014 the borders will turn red to show that they know where you are. At this time, an enemy may even throw the alarm to call in reinforcements. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/198f7805c2a977457e2bd25e2a66374f186d4ba3.jpg The enemies themselves also follow this color-coded system. Red dots on the minimap indicate enemies rushing to engage in combat, while yellow dots represent enemies on the lookout. With fast movement and clever repositioning, it\u2019s possible to get out of the alert state. Red will revert to yellow when they\u2019ve lost you but are still on guard for your whereabouts, and then will return to a less aggressive state\u00a0if you continue to remain out of sight. At this point, you can resume your stealth operations, or just get into a better position before going guns blazing again. Play It Again OCMs reward exploration and repeated playthroughs with weapons and items found throughout the level. When you replay an OCM, you get to customize your starting Loadout based on the weapons and items you\u2019ve found in previous playthroughs. Start the mission with your Parachute and Ascender already in hand, plus any extra Armor Plate carrying capacity earned through Vests. Use your enhanced starting gear to push into higher difficulty levels and/or try out new tactics. Top 5 Tips for Open Combat Missions {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/338f0786baf1363bc8d92008d45eb65276e2a3c1.jpg 1. There\u2019s always another way. Grab a vehicle and race past the sentries straight to the objective; dive into the water and reposition out of sight; use your Parachute to soar over enemy encampments. OCMs offer endless possibilities in how you approach the task at hand. If something\u2019s not working, revisit your tactics and take a new approach. 2. The right gear for the job. While at first, you\u2019ll need to make do with the gear you\u2019re provided, with enough exploration and scavenging, you\u2019ll soon a wider variety of equipment that can best suit your style of play. If you\u2019re going stealth, Throwing Knives and a Recon Drone are better choices than Frag Grenades and unsuppressed weapons and vice versa. 3. Know your enemy. Even if you\u2019re not going the stealth route, it pays to stay out of sight and scout nearby enemy positions. Look for red vehicles on the minimap indicating enemy patrols, and scan the horizon for snipers and other threats you might miss when rushing straight in. Regardless of your approach, that intel will help you make better decisions in the heat of the moment. 4. Build up your arsenal. OCMs encourage replayability through the accumulation of weapons and items found in the level. Use your arsenal to build out the perfect Loadout on subsequent playthroughs and get right to the task at hand without first needing to scavenge for the proper supplies. 5. Ramp up the challenge. Use your expanded arsenal on subsequent playthroughs to push into higher difficulty levels. Tackling an OCM on Veteran is much more manageable when deploying with your preferred Loadout.

It\u2019s now a vacant site, the nearby statues of General Barkov defaced following his downfall. Tread carefully through the resort courtyard, where vantage points from multiple angles present danger to those below. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/4372ff4d369ce7bae141694a84ad55aad54d329c.jpg Orlov Military Base (Ground War): Missile silos lie at the heart of the Orlov Military Base alongside bunkers and facilities built into the mountainous terrain that dominates the northern portion of the map. Scattered barricades throughout provide squads with a means of defense when pushing into the area. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/33612ee198e787569e607ac84ebe4aaadb1bf61f.jpg Popov Power (Ground War): The workhorse of Urzikstan, Popov Power supplies energy to the growing region. Fight around the plant\u2019s cooling towers and containment structures and utilize the full run of its industrial buildings to flank and ambush enemy squads. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/a1af50d7c9e2b5b04615ac7416a766d2cefe2b82.jpg Operation: Spearhead (War Mode): At launch, the first location within Operation Spearhead is the large-scale Urzikstan map, inside a linear corridor within the Orlov Military Base and Kadurin Silo. Clear anti-aircraft defenses so armored vehicles can be airdropped, staying close to the armor to break through to the launch site and set up missile overrides in this thrilling 6v6 battle! Modern Warfare II: Carry Forward Maps {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/b31871315bcb1e56eb93fbc641af6ff08a12e4ca.jpg To further augment an already-impressive selection of Core 6v6 maps, we are excited to announce that a number of fan-favorite Modern Warfare II maps will gradually become available to play in Modern Warfare III throughout the live seasons. The initial selection \u2014 scheduled to be four Core 6v6 maps that include Farm 18, Mercado, and Shoot House \u2014 will become available shortly after launch in a dedicated Playlist, and more will follow throughout the Live Seasons. Here's some beneficial intel about these additions: These maps are graphically identical to how they appeared in MWII, and due to the innovations to movement and general gameplay mechanics present in MWIII, you may find that they play in an altogether different manner. These maps are completely additive, meaning they are scheduled to appear in addition to a full complement of new (and remastered) seasonal maps and other content. New MWIII modes (such as Cutthroat) will not be playable on these Carry Forward MWII maps. Operators: SpecGru and KorTac Reinforcements {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/42501705/40635dc84b50ba2fa96cdca65fc08028d9717cc2.jpg Expect 25 additional Modern Warfare III Operators (13 SpecGru, 12 KorTac) to bolster the Operator pool, allowing you to select from a total of over 90 different Operators across MWII and MWIII. Some Operators are instantly accessible. Locked Operators can be unlocked via in-game challenges or purchased in-Store. Any MWII Operators you have acquired will be carried forward and can be used in MWIII.
