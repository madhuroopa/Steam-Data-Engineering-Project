"Valve looks to be teasing the imminent release of Counter-Strike 2, if we're reading this cheeky Tweet correctly. The game has been in limited, closed beta testing since March, when it was initially announced. Valve always said that Counter-Strike 2 would be available for everyone sometime in the summer, so there's only really one way to interpret this Tweet from the official Counter-Strike account. ""What are you doing next Wednesday?"" it asks, referring to September 27. That would <em>technically</em> put it outside of the summer season, since that ends September 23. But we don't need to be literal here.

This is a renovation of the gyro ""As Mouse"" mode. Expect frequent changes to UI and behavior while we evaluate this new replacement. (""As Mouse"" will remain for now.) Natural Sensitivity Scale: use ""Pixels Per 360°"" to calibrate both the Flick Stick and Gyro's real world angles into in-game angles. In this way, your Gyro Natural Sensitivity Multiplier can be consistent across games, with ""Pixels Per 360°"" being the isolated tuning value for each game. 1€ Filter: Smoothed low level gyro noise without adding delay. Speed Deadzones and Precision Zones will allow you to tune preferences for hand shake during fine aim. Yaw vs. Roll Blend: you can now blend between ""Yaw"" or ""Roll"" mode. Gyro Momentum Option: releasing your gyro activation button can maintain some rotation from the gyro. Tune the momentum on independent axes to bias toward horizontal movement vs vertical movement. Gyro sensor timestamps are now used resulting in better overall accuracy of the Gyro. Gyro over Bluetooth improvements - gyro motion is extrapolated when Bluetooth packets are delayed, resulting in smoother movement. Any error incurred is corrected gradually over time, during high speed movement to avoid ""Ouija effect"" during precise aiming. Fixed Roll axis on Steam Deck for legacy ""As Mouse"". Fix delayed input when opening the standalone On-Screen Keyboard Fix for Razer Wolverine V2 Pro Dualsense gyro.

Моддер Halk Hogan PL спустя всего две недели после анонса выпустил первую версию мода HD Reworked Project для Starfield. 	Starfield can be a rather gorgeous game at times. Peer too closely, however, and you'll start to notice the cracks in the facade. Many of the game's textures and effects don't hold up to close inspection, while a lot of the faces have a rather plastic look to them - something you'll likely become very aware of, given how close in proximity Bethesda NPCs like to stand while you're chatting to them. Fortunately, legendary Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 mod creator 'Halk Hogan' is here to instantly improve your Starfield graphics. Read the rest of the story...

Since its recent release, players have been flying through the interstellar setting in search of new companions, missions, and more. If you've played the game yourself, then you've likely come across the adorable cube-shaped Chunks food items. Every time I see one of the Chunks, I'm not sure whether I'm hungry or scared.

Though it's technically possible, if you want to fly organically between planets in the same system without going into the menus, it takes hours upon hours of real time. Starfield is at its best when you lose yourself in its visuals, its atmosphere, and its serene, cosmic pace. As it stands, jumping in and out of the Starmap every time you want to travel breaks up the journey - that wonderful sense of traveling that you get in Skyrim, Fallout, and the rest of the Elder Scrolls series, is rarer in Starfield without seamless flying.

"According to the voice of Astarion himself, there's a whole two hour section of Baldur's Gate 3 no one has played yet. Baldur's Gate 3 is a mammoth sized game, with a ridiculous number of routes and storylines you can experience. It's fitting considering the nature of its Dungeons and Dragons origins, but it also means that most players probably aren't going to experience it all. But it seems even the completionists out there haven't quite seen everything yet, as Neil Newborn, fan favourite Astarion's voice actor, has said there's a two hour long section nobody has managed to find so far (thanks, GameSpot). ""There's even something I know about that you can't get to unless you do something that I don't think anyone's going to work out,"" Newborn said in the livestream, which you can see him talk about in a clip above. ""I was told this in confidence and I think I'm one of the few people who knows about it as well."" In the stream Newborn was even asked if he could tell the person he was talking to what it is, but noted ""it's one of those few things I cannot friend-DA."" Just to clarify, Newborn will have signed an NDA to work on this project, unsurprisingly, but people are people and they do tell their friends things, but this seems like something so secretive he can't even do that.

Magic Mirror Tucked away in your camp, exuding a certain ‘we found this at a vintage fair and it’s too fancy for our current home’ energy, is an item called the Magic Mirror. Tales have been told of its legendary ability to permanently alter the appearance of one who gazes into it. The Magic Mirror allows you to change up your appearance whenever you’d like, however many times you’d like. There are some restrictions: your appearance, voice, pronouns and nether regions can be changed, but your race/subrace and body type cannot. Origin characters, hirelings and full illithids cannot use the Magic Mirror. Cosmetic modifications that are a consequence of your gameplay choices will persist – hag got your eye?

With its steadfast love of imploding skulls and disintegrating ribcages, Mortal Kombat has always been the most adolescent of fighting games. Mortal Kombat 1 might be using its conspicuous numeric digit to suggest a reset or rethink of some kind, but in truth it isn't remotely concerned with reinventing its world of misfits. While part of me wishes this surface-level overhaul had been more radical, it's maybe unwise to expect that. For decades this series has embraced its love of brainless ultraviolence and childish storytelling. If Mortal Kombat 1 can be praised for anything, it is unwavering kommitment to the bit.

You're not going to be surprised to hear that combos are an incredibly important aspect of pretty much all fighting games, but that doesn't mean they're an easy thing to pull off. You need to memorise all the potential inputs, and you obviously have to consider what your opponent is going to do. But sometimes, when things line up just right, you can pull off a touch of death combo, and almost completely obliterate whoever you're up against. A little bit of context: in fighting games, touch of death combos essentially put your opponent in a position where they can't react at all due to constantly being stunlocked, letting you whittle down their health to zero, or at the very least close to zero. They are seriously difficult to pull off and often have tonnes of prerequisites, but if you do manage to do so it's wildly impressive. As demonstrated below by Twitter user BasicsStupidity, they all look very cool. Read more 	1971870

While developer Starbreeze has been open with communication and quick to fix issues, there may still be a rocky road ahead. For most multiplayer games, server issues come with the territory. When too many people try to play the game at once, sometimes those servers just can't hack it. Payday 3 is no different, and too many heisters spoil the... heist. Or something.

View charts and more statistics on our website.	As someone who played and very much enjoyed the two previous Payday games, dropping into Starbreeze's sequel for this Payday 3 review felt natural. Like a home from home. While it makes a comfy and familiar first impression, the truth is that the changes within this heist multiplayer game are far from surface level. There has always been a risk/reward dilemma in the series, and this is amplified wonderfully in the latest installment. A fresh coat of paint is also appreciated, but the mechanical changes under the hood are where Payday 3 really shines. Read the rest of the story...

Heroes of Arkesia, The newest Ark Pass arrives on September 20 and adds new ways for players to earn impactful rewards just by playing Lost Ark. Players can complete missions to progress through 30 Ark Pass levels, and with each level reached, new rewards will be unlocked and earned. The regular Ark Pass is completely free and grants a variety of helpful rewards, such as Pheons, honing material selection chests, pirate coins, and even a Legendary Card Pack! Ark Pass progress is earned across your entire roster, and the rewards are roster bound. While all players will have access to the free Ark Pass, those interested in more rewards and cosmetics can exchange Royal Crystals for two premium reward tracks (Premium & Super Premium) which each layer in additional rewards to the leveling track. The Premium Ark Pass adds rewards at all 30 levels earned alongside the free rewards. Examples include more honing material selection chests, battle items, rapport chests, and more!

On behalf of our development team, I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to each and every player who has taken the time to play our game. There are many things we would like to discuss, but today, we wanted to share our plans for the future. We have received numerous feedback and bug reports from our players, and we're working hard to address them through an update. As gamers ourselves, we understand how frustrating it can be when a game doesn't work as it should. Rest assured, we're preparing an update to address those issues while maintaining the stability of the game. Furthermore, we promise to share additional details on the upcoming update very soon, once they have been finalized. In addition, we will be providing a roadmap of the contents planned for Lies of P as soon as it is ready. Once again, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your support.

Bungie will be removing the currency entirely from the game with the launch of the next expansion, The Final Shape. However, changes will start taking place at the launch of Season 23, which is kicking off at the end of November. First, Legendary Shard costs will be removed from the Monument to Lost Lights. Then, non-Adept focusing will no longer cost Shards. Finally, all Legendary Shards will be remove with the release of the expansion.

Recently, my Destiny 2 clanmates and I took the healthy and responsible decision not to participate in the next raid race.

Players will explore the familiar yet unsettling panoramas of The Pale Heart, the first linear destination in Destiny 2. When the campaign has been completed, there's plenty more coming. In the new raid, Guardians will confront the Witness head on and try to break its hold on The Pale Heart.

It’s a hope that fans of Respawn’s beloved shooter have been holding onto for the best part of a decade now, but recent evidence in the form of quiet updates to Titanfall 2 and a cryptic teaser for its spiritual successor Apex Legends has given them renewed hope that something new might be on the way. Read more 	After years of being unplayable online, Titanfall 2 has recently received an update that finally allows for multiplayer once again. For a long while now, the much loved but not massively successful first person shooter Titanfall 2 has been essentially impossible to play online. But, as shared in the Titanfall subreddit, the game has had an update that appears to have fixed the game's multiplayer servers. Up until recently, matchmaking was basically impossible, and server stability was often shaky at best. This recent update has fixed those issues though, alongside adding in new and old game modes, which have been rotated in and out since the update went live. A number of other issues have been changed too, like glitches, out-of-bounds exploits, as well as some changes to the map's geometry. Most notably, though, a number of Nessie plushies, Apex Legend's mascot, that are holding hammers have been spotted across the various parts of the maps that have been tweaked, as spotted by another user on Reddit.
