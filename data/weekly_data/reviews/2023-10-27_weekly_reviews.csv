1086940,This game is horrid I played it all the way to the end only to form a more full opinion It fails in so many ways The gameplay highlights the flaws in the DnD system making a lot of it very boring especially combat For nonDnD players the mindnumbing complexity of character building from the very beginning is blindingly overwrought The ending is so long dull and ridiculous that I quit halfway through the final battle with only one feeling I want my money back This is all that is bad about RPGs mixed with all that is bad about DnD taking away anything good from each and throwing it down the drain The only reason this game has had any attention from players is that mixed into the poor game is unnecessary sex scenes to fulfill the needs of sexstarved gamers Dont waste your money on this piece of garbage,neg

1086940,Even running a PC that exceeds the recommended requirements this game doesnt launch Throw it back in the oven for another year and work out these bugs,neg
1086940,Way too much forced LGBTQ stuff  Like a weird bizarre amount of it  Not passive like shoved in your face  Lots of quests and subplots are bugged still and get broken like the one with the little girl whos parents you need to find  Story was fairly engaging but too much emphasis on the pseudoSciFi feeling stuff IMO  Also not enough time spent in the Baldurs Gate city itself for my taste  Very cool city environment but It was kind of thrown in during the last act and felt short and fleeting   I was surprised that there was no daynight cycle and therefore no opportunity for night time prowling and burglarizing shops while people are asleep etc which would have been cool since I went with a thief direction for my character assuming there would be that sort of thing but whatever  The camping function was pretty cool  other than always wondering if the next camping cutscene was going to include a party member of the same sex trying to seduce you as well as the games dialogue options also trying to nudge you towards samesex romance stuff totally out of the blue  Again just weird and kind of killed the enjoyable feeling of the game  Youd think if it was so important to the writers then they would have made some sort of orientation option available during character creation that would dictate the occurrence or likelihood of these kinds of things throughout the game  But overall the camping function was pretty cool novel and well implemented  Combat is pretty cool at first but becomes longwinded  On the one hand a lot of the graphics and effects especially for magic are VERY well done  And also the combat SOUND whoever worked on the SOUNDS for this game needs a pay raise  The sounds are AMAZING  But on the other hand yeah the combat does end up being a little too longwinded and slow and annoying after a while   Would I play the game again  Just to see what sort of slightly different story lines there might be  Probably not  Overall I would say this was fairly fun but did not live up to the hype that Id heard in gamer media and is probably not in my top 10,neg
1086940,"Id love to give this game a positive review until act 3 it was probably the best RPG Ive played since KOTOR Most companions are interesting there is a fair bit of freedom of how you go about things until act 3 What made me feel I have to give this game a negative review though is that once I finally get to Baldurs Gate I am extremely limited in how I can go about things all of a sudden I chose to attack an NPC in a building in Baldurs Gate after that every single Red Fist in the city attacks me on sight making it impossible to get around No way to even pay a bounty or go to prison this is after Lord Gortash already said the guards wont give me any bother since I made an agreement with him I would expect in a game that is supposed to give near maximum freedom in choices for me to be able to talkpay my way out of it once all witnesses to the attack have been dealt with 

On top of that I have come across a lot of inconsistencies with dialogue particularly late game One example being despite the fact I didnt take Gale with me to fight Lord Ketheric the dialogue with him afterwards acts as though he did come with me This kind of dialogue inconsistency is highly immersion breaking and its not the first instance Ive seen of it",neg

1086940,"While this game felt like it was polished and was going to be a good game the core gameplay felt odd and clunky with the weird camera controls

After a few hours of gameplay I did not find myself wanting to continue to play this game and thats coming from a pretty hardcore RPG player I really wanted to like it but my brain said no

1086940,the multiplayer is terrible and has gamebreaking bugs in  and by gamebreaking i mean you have to start an entire new playthrough to fix it   or every time you load everyone is controlling the wrong character and you cant fix it without everyone closing the game and reopening it which takes around 10 minutes  and half the time we load into the wrong characters again  DO NOT BUY if you want to play with irl friends,neg

1086940,Absolutely awful system built upon awful system,neg
1086940,I think it is a good game BUT I just cant get into it  Mostly I dont feel any motivation or connection to the characters and especially the companions  I just dislike all the companions  My other personal dislike is  you have to be able to handle failure  You cant always get the outcomes you always want and the limited options in responses kind of frustrate me  Finally I was looking a bit more action and knowing who the enemy  the good and bad is that there are many ways to deal with situations but not usually the one I would pick or want  ALL of this is just my personal view  I think the game will be great for many people  I just didnt get into it or want to go back to play more  personal preference,neg

 You forget what reality is
 Beautiful
 Good
 Decent
 Bad
 Dont look too long at it
 MSDOS

The games graphics are beautiful though innacurate at times Screen space reflections are the chosen method making them less accurate MW3 will have RayTracing so itll be much better if you can run it

 Gameplay 
 Very good
 Good
 Its just gameplay
 Mehh
 Watch paint dry instead
 Just dont

This is highly determined by what modedifficulty you choose the campaign Story can feel repetitive and multiplayerbattle royale is a repeating loop I completed the campaign and moved to the DMZ mode an extractionsandbox mode 

 Audio 
 Eargasm
 Very good
 Good
 Not too bad
 Bad
 Im now deaf

The audio is very good however directional audio is hard to decipher because enemies sound like they wear size 27 Nikes

 Audience 
 Kids
 Teens
 Adults
 Grandma

The campaign is about a cartel gameplay is guns and murder You tell me

 PC Requirements 
 Check if you can run paint
 Potato
 Decent
 Fast
 Rich boi
 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

This game does require a semibeefy PC
I use a 2080 on a ryzen 7 1080p 60fps and it hitches on occasion

 Difficulty 
 Just press W
 Easy
 Easy to learn  Hard to master
 Significant brain usage
 Difficult
 Dark Souls

Depends on the mode multiplayer is fast paced whoever has better aim typically wins DMZ and battle royale require decent positioning etc Campaign is fairly easy

 Grind 
 Nothing to grind
 Only if u care about leaderboardsranks
 Isnt necessary to progress
 Average grind level
 Too much grind
 Youll need a second life for grinding

This also depends on the mode the campaign provides everything you need for it grinding is present in multiplayer modes including DMZ you will grind weapon levels for attachments and player levels for weapons

 Story 
 No Story
 Some lore
 Average
 Good
 Lovely
 Itll replace your life

The campaign has 70 of the story the raid has 20 and DMZ has 10 The campaigns story is fairly straightforward and enjoyable the raid has a good story and DMZ requires attentive eyes to reveal story

 Game Time 
 Long enough for a cup of coffee
 Short
 Average
 Long
 To infinity and beyond

The campaign is a decent length of gameplay it does feel a little dragged on near the end Multiplayer matches are typically 515 minutes and battle royale matches are about 20 minutes DMZ matches are 30 minutes or less if you exfil early

 Price 
 Its free
 Worth the price
 If its on sale
 If u have some spare money left
 Not recommended
 You could also just burn your money

If you enjoy semitactical fps games this is a good purchase or try out the DMZ mode to get a feel for the gunplay there are free modes to try

 Bugs 
 Never heard of
 Minor bugs
 Can get annoying
 ARK Survival Evolved
 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

An area in the campaign has severe lightning issues I will occasionally spawn in DMZ without my weapon sometimes I die and my body falls somewhere unreachable

1938090,"As much as Ive eagerly cherished the Call of Duty franchise since its inception I must admit that my recent experience with the latest installment has been overwhelmingly disheartening Despite having a lightningfast internet connection and a toptier gaming rig this particular game has brought forth a plethora of issues that Ive never encountered before
The frustration stems from the inexplicable and relentless disconnections I face both in the singleplayer campaign and during multiplayer sessions What perplexes me even more is the complete absence of any discernible pattern to these disruptions Its as if the game has developed a whimsical desire to disconnect me whenever it pleases

1938090,"DMZ started out as an absolutely amazing Tarkovlite  I was skeptical when my friends wanted me to try it and was blown away by how brave the devs had been to make a mode like this under the CoD banner  

Unfortunately its been two steps backward one step forward since season 1  What started as an openworld multiobjective extraction shooter is now a circus of theme events cartoon characters and paytowin bundles  The mechanics have been corrupted over time to reward players on controllers with teenagerearly20s reflexes and punish players who are good at planning tactics and execution

Its also almost certainly being killed in favor of Zombies because theyre taking the conservative route of chasing a cashcow audience of the lowest common denominator instead of building a new one out of woefully underserved player types 

I do hope another AAA company has noticed the initial success of this mode in its original glory and is building a replacement",neg

I dont often write reviews but I feel compelled to express my disappointment with Season 18

The matchmaking system is seriously flawed In many instances I find myself pitted against either lowlevel cheaters or seasoned predators which has seriously hampered the enjoyment for my friends and me And this is on nonAsian servers I can only imagine what the experience would be like there

Regarding the ingame shop and events the offerings have been lackluster at best It seems that Respawn and EA are attempting to recoup losses from Seasons 16 and 17 but the current state of the game provides little incentive for financial investment This is coming from someone who has purchased over 1200 gold skins and 22 heirlooms If things continue this way I foresee a significant decline in the player base and its disappointing that the developers dont seem to acknowledge this

The gameplay itself has become so unbalanced that it encourages teaming which in my view undermines the competitive nature of the game Its evident that the studios focus has shifted away from the needs and experiences of average players Ive decided to step back from the game for now and will consider returning once improvements have been made

From a greatly disappointed player


Sep 21st 2023

Are you out of your freaking mind WTF WTF is this normal game mode Do not force your customers to play shift There is no loot And fix your freaking match making system If you knew the old map is shift thats why you changed it dramatically dont just put it back in a even worse form You want money I get it and you know the easiest way to get money for you Make players like your game Not Making them QUIT 

Previously you had the decency to allow players to choose what to play normal or some horseshift mode This time What is wrong with you Respawn STOP FEEDING US SHIFT  Have you learnt nothing since the last time this game has died 

WHO is in you management team  WHO are your PROJECT MANAGERS

Havent played this game in a while my life seems to be much better But God WHY would I open this game again There are reasons maps are reworked and these maps SUCK It is clearly visible that EA and Respawn have data analysts but they do not base their analysis on reality but imagination They should not be making these decisions Shift game and I heard the ranked system for next season is built for cheaters expect them coming as if there werent enough",neg

949230,"Cities Skylines 2 is an absolute triumph in the world of citybuilding games Its an exhilarating sequel that takes everything we loved about the original Cities Skylines and elevates it to new heights delivering an outstanding urban planning experience thats nothing short of phenomenal

First and foremost the level of detail in Cities Skylines 2 is aweinspiring The games graphics have been significantly upgraded with stunning visuals that bring your city to life The attention to detail in the architecture road networks and even the citizens themselves is truly remarkable Its like watching a miniature world come to life on your screen and its a testament to the developers dedication to creating a visually captivating experience",pos

949230,Long city cuilder here  All the bad press and anger is unwarranted  Of all the city sims that have launched this one has the fewest bugs on launch day  Im certain it will continue to evolve into one heck of a cool game to spend your life on,pos
949230,"As a devoted fan of the original Cities Skylines I eagerly delved into the muchanticipated sequel Cities Skylines 2 While the game undeniably retains the charm and addictive gameplay that made its predecessor a hit my overall experience was tinged with a hint of disappointment owing to the apparent unfinished nature of certain aspects

Undoubtedly Cities Skylines 2 introduces several exciting new features and mechanics that breathe fresh life into the franchise The enhanced graphics and improved detailing add a sense of vibrancy and realism to the bustling cityscapes allowing for a more immersive experience overall The addition of intricate transit systems expanded city management tools and a more robust economic simulation undoubtedly deepens the gameplay allowing for more strategic and nuanced decisionmaking

However the developers decision to release what feels like an incomplete game has left me with mixed feelings While my personal experience has been relatively smooth Im aware of the reported performance issues that have plagued some players Furthermore the absence of certain expected features and the need for subsequent updates to fulfill the games true potential has left a discernible void

Despite these reservations its hard to deny the addictive nature of Cities Skylines 2 The core gameplay loop which involves balancing the intricacies of urban planning and resource management remains as engaging as ever The creative freedom provided in designing and customizing ones metropolis is a playground for the imagination allowing players to manifest their urban planning dreams with stunning detail

In conclusion Cities Skylines 2 while undeniably enjoyable and addictive feels like a diamond in the rough The potential is palpable but the unfinished state has undoubtedly hindered the game from reaching the heights it could have achieved With the promise of future updates and patches I remain cautiously optimistic about the direction the game will take For now its a solid foundation with immense potential leaving players like myself eager to see the game realize its full glory in the future",pos

949230,Fantastic game I have been playing it for 4 hours so far and it is everything I had wished CS had been Was hesitant to buy it given the initial negative reaction but for me it is running smoothly no hiccups Loving it,pos
949230,"Really deserving of mixed reviews This should have really released into early access The developers did themselves no favors by defaulting everyones settings to high Game is about as good as how well you can tolerate mediocre performance how much some systems of CS1 annoyed you and how much trust you put into the devs to make it better I would say that you should either try this on gamepass or strikeabusestrike utilize steams 2 hour14 day return policy to try it out for yourself and make your own judgement

AMD Ryzen 7 3700X  gtx 1080  game is installed on an SSD My PC is just barely over minimum spec and on lowmedium settings I get about 30fps50fps at 1080p Game will stutter occasionally and fps can drop into the 20s at times I think 60fps at 1080p should be the bare minimum for any game in any genre released today but in my opinion you will likely gloss over the performance issues as you start to actually play the game If you cant then who am I to tell you that you are wrong Issue the return with steam and leave a negative review saying how its unacceptable so that the devs know to make it their 1 priority going forward

The building and simulation is leagues above what CS1 provides The road building tools are amazing The traffic simulation is top notch The vanilla radio music is much better A lot of the DLC that was in CS1 is now vanilla in CS2 The scale of the cities you can build is massively increased The game itself once you start laying down the roads infrastructure zones add in details and watch people drive around and start to formulate plans for how you are going to address issues in your city you can feel how melodramatic the response to this game has been",pos
949230,Game is a bit too slow steam workshop not available but other than that its a fun game,pos
949230,"I love the sim aspect of it You can see ideas from CS1 but also Simcity 4 I would argue that the fact that you can unlock tiles  anywhere is akin to simcity 4s regions Also I have a city 110k and the game keeps me on my toes still If you zone big it creates bigger proprieties and also cost a lot in taxes You have to zone smaller lots for poorer cims I think its a very good idea You also have all the tools to succeed graphs info layers like commercial interest in a zone on the map and cie 

Of course like any reviews will tell theres perf problems I have a 3060 on my gaming laptop and deactivated some effects according to tips by someone who analyzed this on youtube very in depth and I never had much troubles because of this I would argue the devs should make those defaults at least for now but hey I dont work for them D hahaha

I think its a very good game very addictive I think its the most fun I had in a city builder because for me everything is there",pos
949230,a big step up from the first one and in my opinion it is easier in ways like managing traffic,pos
949230,"After having initially dabbled in CIties Skylines II for around 30 hours at this point Im amazed This game is a substantial upgrade to the original and is a much more matured detailed and realistic experience Almost everything I could have ever wanted CS1 to be this game is

If the problems and lacking we are experiencing now are the worst it will be the future is bright for CS2 Performance aside the gameplay of this game is superb and if you love city builders this is among the best entries into the genre to date",pos
949230,A fantastic game At release there are some tweaks that could be made but none of them really distract from the fun you can have Very obvious continued developmentupdatesDLC will only make this game better and better as time goes by,pos
949230,"13900k  4090 Running fine averaging about 7090 fps at 1440p depending on how much detail is on screen Everything maxed but with depth of field and motion blur disabled The only real slowdowns are when plopping massive buildings like the graveyard specifically while moving the camera in that info overlay view


If youre playing with a newer  higher end platform youll be perfectly fine and its worth playing now Its an objectively good game and an improvement over the first in so man ways

If youre playing with older hardware maybe wait for some optimizations

Also the thing everyone is conveniently ignoring CS1 needed so many mods and so many assets that it was a slideshow on anything that wasnt a new game CS2 in its present state runs better than CS1 with all the necessary mods And while there are some I miss dearly move it for example the list of mandatory mods is going to be a whole lot shorter as the base game itself is so vastly improved Ask literally anyone whos done large scale highdetail builds in CS1 30 fps wouldve been a welcome relief even on the best hardware you could get 5 years ago",pos

949230,"Honestly not sure Spent about an hour trying to actually start the game it kept crashing from missing Paradox Launcher files I guess Worked after a complete reinstallation Then I spent 10 minutes in the main menu it works pretty well Then I spent 10 minutes trying to play and it crashed on me 3 times before I decided to write this review

Looks promising in the long run as lots of new features have been added by the looks of things as compared to Cities Skylines but give it a few months Didnt exactly get to explore the menues as the game instantly freezes when I start a new game but the main menu is pretty fluid and smooth at least

Update Managed to get into the game for a while and it plays pretty smoothly and I get around 60 fps on medium which isnt really okay as I have a pretty midtohigh specced computer but thats an optimisation problem What isnt okay is that it actually blue screened my computer somehow Never had this happen before with other games on release hell even Cyberpunk was more stable Maybe its not CS2 related at all just some initial thoughts",neg
949230,"Reviewed on 102723 after the first live patch  WAIT TILL IT GOES ON SALE

I wont cover the graphical glitches and subpar frame rates as they have acknowledged it and are working on resolving it

Coming from Cities Skylines 1 and around 1000 hours I can say visually this looks amazing Thats about all I can say positive for now until they start patching the game I can see where they wanted to go and freshen up the whole game and UI system but they have some challenges for overhauling an entire game

1 I dont feel immersed in the game my city isnt alive to me as it felt in Skylines 1 Hopefully mods DLC and added features down the road will help that

2 missing ALL the features that made Skylines 1 good Making zones now is complicated Setting up districts is confusing Are there other settings to prevent high rises from being built when I district off an area  Can i have priority responses to specific locations  Why do I have a medical center in one distractarea thats not sending ambulances but I have a medical center across the map sending them over

3 the road that ends at the edge of the mapwhy are networked roads that go off map just ending into an abyss  Why not continue them off so it appears seamless 

4 the schools take up WAY more space than they need to  Who builds old 1940s era schools that big anymore  not a lot of variety to pick from is disappointing We got a bare bones version with no extras which leads me to believe they will nickle and dime ALL THE DLC since that will be their money maker after putting a strangle hold on MODS restricted to their own platform  RIP STEAMWORKSHOP access

1085660,"Ok before I begin my review I must mention that I have spent over 1000 hours on the Epic Store version of Destiny 2 but Steam may say otherwise I havent done everything there is to do in this game but I have done enough to give you the pros and cons of the game So lets begin

If you are new to Destiny 2 it might be confusing to know where to start especially storywise Over the years there has been a lot of content going in and out of the game The developer used to vault old content even expansions in the past but they stopped doing that business model However that isnt to say that the story can still feel fragmented

Some of the very early plot lines that was introduced with the release of the game are gone The introduction has been changed and once you are done with it as a new player you are then left to explore the rest of the game without a proper continuation I think this is the biggest weakness of the game It can make new players leave the game before discovering the true gem content

Now Destiny 2s biggest weakness can also be considered its biggest strength at the same time If you have all the DLCs and expansions you can pretty much start wherever you want There is a lot to do and while it can be overwhelming at first you dont really have to do the different stories in a chronological order The game features different antagonists or villains and you can take on their stories in whichever order you choose

Do note that the Beyond Light expansion gives you the Stasis subclass Lightfall gives you the Strand subclass Without these two expansions you are left with the three default classes Arc Solar and Void The Witch Queen also gives you the weapon crafting system This is one of the games greatests features You are less forced to rely on RNG

Anyways if you are into looter shooters then this is a great game There are many different weapon classes and types There are also a ton of weapon perks so many that it can be hard to pick Ignore the meta and go for whatever you prefer  You have so many options here

Additionally each subclass come with different slottable abilities and also slottable class effects fragments Destiny 2 also features an armor mod system where you can slot in effects that will enhance your class and other things Combine all of this with the games large pool of weapons and perks and you can create a powerful character build of your choice

In addition the game comes with skinstransmog and shaders for all of your gear Your character guardian will not look like anyone elses character Everyone is unique So if you are into fashion then there is a lot to chase efter Yes a lot of it has to be earned by playing the game There is an ingame store that sells items for real money most of which are cosmetics

So what is bad about the game apart from a fragment story Well this game requires dedication and commitment There is seasonal content and there are also regular holiday events It takes time to complete milestone objectives However each of these come with good but optional shaders ships ghosts little helper drone weapons and shaders etc If you want all of that you need to actually play the game You cannot buy actual weapons and armor gear from the store

You cannot paytowin and there is a lot of grind in this game The weapon crafting system helps mitigate that problem but you still have to find blueprints of the weapons that you want to craft There is a lot of RNG involved in getting those blueprints So if you want to craft everything you need to put hours into the game

But you are rarely alone Destiny 2 features a matchmaking system for many of its game modes You and other players will share some of the burden of grinding dungeons Story missions and world exploration can still be done solo If you are not into matchmaking you can join up with a friend and play nearly all the content together

And that is what makes the game fun to play",pos
1085660,great game however you are basically obligated to buy season passes and DLCs to be able to enjoy the full game if you do not you will be missing out  its a choice I do think this game is definately worth playing because its good both as a single player and for multiplayer it has both pvp and pve and if you want to do dungeons and raids you can use the discord to take part in that i have spend over 700 hours in this game simply farming legendaries and its still my big hobby so if you enjoy farming for engrams with gear and upgrading and finding every single legendary then there is pleanty to do,pos

1085660,"Destiny 2 is not a complete game Its also a game where it doesnt matter if you buy all the DLC or not your content can and will be taken away from you instead thus meaning youve literally wasted your money to play content that only serves to be thrown in the trash can later with only about 5 of it going to just come back again later to be resold to you AGAIN
Not to mention the Story WILL NOT make any sense to people who havent already played yet thanks to so much content being flat out deleted in the first place Youll have to find someone else to spoonfeed you it via videos or talking to a veteran instead of figuring it out for yourself in the actual game which means even more time to waste in order to even remotely understand what the side characters in your ear are constantly yapping about to make any sense

TLDR
if you dont value your time and have alot of money to burn for FOMO content that WILL be taken away from you later go ahead and jump in If Not Literally play ANYTHING else Hell you want a similar game thats ACTUALLY Free Go play Warframe instead",neg

1085660,"Im sure there are better more cohesive reviews here but Ive been a fan of this game since the first game launched on the Xbox 360 and i wanted to air out my grievances with the direction Destiny has been going particularly the monetization While the gameplay of Destiny is SOLID it is still one of if not the best feeling shooters i have ever played Bungies greed and overmonetization have ultimately pushed me away as no matter how fun and addicting the gunplay is it still doesnt justify the absurd lengths Bungie have gone to just to take a few more bucks out of your wallet Keep in mind i havent played Destiny 2 since the launch of Season of The Deep so i havent really kept up with news regarding Bungie and Destiny 2 outside of the announcement of Marathon

         Firstly the upfront cost for just getting access to the existing Expansion content is already ridiculous Currently setting new players back a whole 190 for Shadowkeep Beyond Light Witch Queen Lightfall Final Shape 30th Anniversary Pack and the Forsaken Pack which at one point in time was the greatest Expansion in D2 history now cannibalized and resold to players as a shell of its former self Keep in mind this price DOESNT include the Annual Pass bundles But this still isnt where it ends as when you get into the game youll have to then buy two Dungeon Keys which are 20 a pop with a third one likely on the way once Final Shape drops But even after all that you still arent done Provided you havent purchased the Annual Pass for the latest Expansion you will then have to spend 15 every few months just to have access to the newest Seasonal content the Season Pass is priced at 12 when you go to buy it but there is no 12 Silver bundle forcing you to overspend and buy 15 worth of silver So all in all not accounting for Annual Pass bundles right out the gate new players have to spend 245 to have access to all the current content in Destiny 2 as well as the upcoming expansion That is just over the price of 4 AAA titles even more if theres a sale going on or youre buying indie titles

         Now I just want to point out the decline in both the quality and the quantity of content in each expansion and well start with Forsaken Forsaken launched with 2 new patrol zones 4 new strikes 4 crucible maps 1 Dungeon 1 Raid the Gambit gamemode RIP NINE new supers that included some new melee abilities as well and 22 exotic weapons and armor Pretty good deal for 40 right now lets compare that to Lightfall which is 10 more than Forsaken For 50 you get 1 new patrol zone 1 new strike ZERO crucible maps at launch no new Dungeon 1 Raid one SubclassElement for the three classes and 9 exotic weapons and armor along with whatever content is included in the current season needless to say there is a drastic difference between what you got before and what you get now LITERALLY paying more for less 

         And now the Eververse Store Oh boy the Eververse store Its very clear that this is where the majority of Bungies effort goes towards in terms of cosmetic gear With each season that comes out the Eververse store is consistently loaded to the gills with armor sets ships sparrows ghost shells ornaments and emotes to buy for ridiculous prices The New Player Tax of 245 is already absurd but tack on 20 armor sets 7 Exotic Ornaments 105 Emotes 6 Ghost Shells 8 Sparrows  Ships and the price can quickly go up if you arent careful It is downright unforgivable that Bungie is charging this much for Eververse content while providing us little in return Forsaking the yearly free armor given to the big four vendors Vanguard Crucible Gambit Trials of Osiris under the guise that they simply dont have the resources to make these armors every year While yes Destiny 2 does have its own currency called Bright Dust that can be used to purchase these items for free the prices for certain things are questionable at most with Exotic Emotes setting you back a whole 3250 Bright dust and Ghost Shells following close behind at 2850 it is impossible to get more than a handful of items from the Eververse Store for free Hell you cant even get the new Eververse armor sets for Bright Dust anymore they straight up removed that option from the Store

         Destiny 2s events I would argue are even worse in this regard having next to nothing worth chasing for Guardians that arent looking to spend money at most having an armor set to obtain during Solstice and at the least having 1 new weapon to farm for Meanwhile the Eververse Store is stocked with new and past event cosmetics while yes all of the armor sets are purchasable for Bright Dust but at 6k per armor set good luck getting all the Bright Dust you need to get everything you want after buying an armor set Theres also their Event Cards which are basically mini Season Passes that run over the course of the event they provide you a handful of bonus cosmetics for the price of 10 the previous price of an entire Season Pass these Event Cards for what they are and what they provide should at most be 5 IMO or just removed from the game Bungie does not need to be monetizing these events even more than they already do

In short do not get invested in this game It will pull you in with its incredible and addicting gameplay monopolize your time drain your wallet dry and then throw you to the curb when theres no more money to be siphoned from you And the worst part is i still might return to play Final Shape The trailer looked good and the art direction is beautiful but be wary because hype is one of Bungies strongest weapons They know how to put together a good trailer look no further than Lightfall I would urge you to hold off on preordering and wait a while for reviews to come out before making your purchase because there is nothing Bungie would love more than to pull you right back in and siphon even more money from you",neg

1085660,"Been thinking about how to make this review in the most objective way possible as ive spent way more time than the average player 54k hours on steam plus probably around 25k between PS4 and XBOX here Id love to recommend this game but it is simply not possible

From an inhands perspective this is a magnificent game with probably the most polished and satisfying gunplay and abilities in the entire market Nothing comes close and thats a fact
The work that the teams in charge of combat audio music art and visual design have done here is one of the best in the business

Now despite that the game has gigantic issues that are hard to overlook once you spend a meaningful period of time with it

1Addiction development

Bungie has designed the gameplay loop and its systems to develop an addictive behavior on the playerbase It is heavily incentivized to play the game on a daily basis or at least on a weekly basis as it uses FOMO Fear of missing out to convince you about staying

If you dont play this activity on this period of time welltough luck this reward will come back when we decide it will come back This leads the player to plan their life around the time frame Bungie deems convinent to provide said rewards You cant openly say well today Im gonna grind this activity to get this weaponmaterial if that activity or reward isnt part of the weekly rotation

You are not the owner of your time

If you dont care about having a competitive edge on PvP or a musthave gun or piece of armor for PvE if you use LFG methods this point will become irrelevant as you can play the activities that you enjoy at your pace instead of feeling forced to do so

2Youre gonna be hereforever

Most of the seasonal content if not all is set to be delivered to the playerbase on a weekly basis until it wraps up The issue here is that Bungie wants you to log in weekly for around 58 weeks if you want to keep up with whats going on but the content is so scarce that in reality the story could be finished in a day and the activities could be completely mastered in a week if the playerbase had the option so they could freely go play something else

The liveservice model has its good and bad things as it ensures the game will be frequently updated with new stuff every 34 months but it can also feel like the game has no end For instance The Final Shape would feel way more important if the game wrapped up there but its been confirmed there will be more stories and content after it but wont move on to a new game like a Destiny 3 or something like that Everything will keep happening on Destiny 2

3Schrdingers reward system Loot is plentiful but it also isnt Some of it can be deemed as musthavebut it also doesnt matter

Crafting in theory was a great concept as it was meant to be a way to alleviate issues with RNG simply denying people of the loot they were chasing after countless grinding sessions

Now the problem with its implementation was the addition of enhanced perks back on Witch Queens release This created a butterfly effect that has
Made the loot chase completely die since once you get the patternblueprint of a gun every future roll of it will be immediately discarded as there is no chance of improving it
Made activities like Raids only need to be completed a handful of times to get the specific loot you want and then you can completely stop doing them which is unfortunate as it is the best content the game provides but at the same time RNG exotics like Vex Mythoclast or Touch of Malice make said content frustrating as you get only a handful of tries to get them per weekly reset
Made actual endgame guns from Master Raids Master Dungeons and Grandmaster Nightfall unable to compete with the crafted guns with enhanced perks becoming completely irrelevant and devoiding these activities of any meaningful possible rewards Artifice Armor is not worth the time unless you REALLY want to minmax
World loot is now worthless with no chance of having some hidden gems pop off like how the Cartesian Coordinate fusion rifle or the Truthteller grenade launcher did
General Play like Strikes or Crucible grant close to nothing other than a handful of glimmer Their loot will mostly come from focusing engrams at the Tower

With that being said the loot doesnt matter because

4The game has never been easier and it will continue down that path

The latest subclass reworks and exotic armor tuning has trivialized most of the game Bungies response to this has been making endgame bosses with overshields immunity phases and health gates meaning most encounters will be unnecessarily extended even if the playerfireteam knows what theyre doing

In the past extending an encounter meant the playerfireteam screwed up at some point but now it is expected

5The core game has been neglected beyond belief

Vanguard Ops Crucible and Gambit have received the least amount of general changes since the seasonal model was implemented back on Shadowkeep Proof of this is the removal of several strikes and maps from both Crucible and Gambit the addition of only 3 maps to Crucible after almost 4 years the addition of Seasonal Battlegrounds to Vanguard Ops that are balanced around seasonal bonuses that no longer exist and complete utter lack of attention to Gambit in any shape or form

The weird part of this is that these 3 are the main population retainers and Bungie expects you to be there ad nauseam yet theyre ignored

The current Game Director has promised to change this and if that happens it would be massive for the playerbase

6Bungie aggressively wants your money

The amount of loot a season has normally is more prone to be in Eververse instead of the endgame This said loot is also massively more appealing and also thrives on FOMO The worst part of this is that prices are really high as there will always be people willing to pay whatever it is necessary to look cool Since these people exist Eververse is nonnegotiable and no consumerfriendly changes will be made on it Ever

7The game is held together by papiermch macaroni and vibes

The technical side of the game has seen some of the most egregiously awful server downtimes and gamebreaking bugs I have seen in the past 2 years Tech issues happen everywhere but when this is coupled with how the game is designed if you miss out on a desired reward because of these issues it leads to massive playerbase disappointment see The Craftening and Server Instability preventing people from getting the Igneous Hammer hand cannon in Trials of Osiris between Sep 15th through Sep 26th 2023

While Valve has done a very good job at keeping the game profitable they have very little to show for it

Playing casual mode outside of peak hours you wont be able to get into a server with real people in it 
Youll be placed in a server filled with autonomous votekicking aimbotusing Sniper players Valve has done virtually nothing to stop this as the singledigit staff maintaining the game literally dont know how to do so The few misguided bandaid fixes put in place have only damaged the game further those on F2P accounts cant chat on official servers let alone call for a medic to heal them Meanwhile bots with premium accounts are wearing unusual quality hats using noisemakers and spamming the chat with links facing no such restrictions

Its been this way for three years and Valve has no incentive to fix any of it The players and their money will continue to trickle in The workshop creators will continue to build the immense backlog of possible future content This dynamic ensures that TF2 remains in a state of limbo neither alive or dead I know its unreasonable to expect updates to a free game 16 years after its release but I feel like the continued SUCCESSFUL monetization of the title should carry at least some weight right

Outside of Valves official matchmaking quality community servers that allow you to play the actual unmodded game are going extinct The few that remain are often home to teamstacked stompfests or have minuscule unvaried map pools that guarantee youll be playing plupward and kothharvest until the end of time In this regard the crippling effects of 2016s Meet Your Match update can still be felt to this day

1485590,"My review is from a single player viewpoint i bet it would be much easier with 3 peeps playing together  

This game is an interesting mesh between dungeon crawler isometric gameplay tower defense and point and click shooter  You can explore but every door you open is kind of like ending a turn in a turn based strategy in order to obtain resources to build defense towers  So far I like a lot of this game 
PROS
Single player can be played with up to 2 extra bots which really helps  Gun combat is very hand eye coordinated with where you move your cursor and where the enemy is so its very easy to hit targets but there is also an auto aim that helps with the margin of error so you often hit your targets  The story feels good and progress makes you want to keep going after every failure  The variety of heroes is nice I can see myself playing many hours of this game unlocking everyone and doing all their quests  Turrets are extremely responsive and the upgrading mechanism for them is pretty great  The rogue like elements for dying and coming back feel very rewarding making me want to keep going in and out upgrading more of my heros
CONS
I wish heroes could gain levels from killing like the turrets can  Hero quests dont progress until you are back from the dungeon so if you complete any quests you are better off dying and looking at the new quest first i made the mistake of doing the bug lady Carties quest and then continued down to kill the floor boss and further only to receive another quest when i got back to kill the floor boss again which is pretty silly  The pistol heros feel kind of weak compared to the heavy weapon heroes  Also I tend to find lots more good heavy weapons over pistol types in the dungeon makes me not want to run any pistol heros  The single player AI would be cooler if they constantly tried to repair and buff turrets when told to stay put near them  I wish i could sell turrets for at least half as much resources or worse even if I could get any for making a mistake putting a turret in the wrong place would help  Im always starved of industry and often the rooms i put them in in later levels cant be protected enough  I really like this game but I still think it needs quite a lot of work will update my review as updates change the game",pos
1485590,If you have humble bundle and can get it for 24 dollars AND have high hopes that the devs will add a lot more content to the game to get it closer to the thirty dollar value go for it But it feels more like a free to play with planned expansions right now pretty bare bones Fun for a bit for sure though,pos
1485590,"Giving the game a positive review for one reason a lot people are forgetting Game is Endless Dungeon NOT Dungeon of the endless 

Personally enjoy the Simple fun and currently mindless game for the most part Coop is fun and allows for some faster play with the better coordination dont forget need to read to understand what is shared and what is not However game feels more like an escort rogue lite then a shooter or tower defense 

Side notes Game devs are fixing the hero unlock and are making improvements 

If I had a criticismsasksfeedback of the Devs for those reading this section it is an escort game with a lot of redundancy for a rogue lite

Add other game modes where it can feel like a shooter or a tower defense game Right now you just escort your bot from doorspot to doorspot Can see why people dont feel good about the game with it being an escort  escorts feel bad man

Make merchants carry special upgrades instead of guns to make them unique Add guns to research or give them their own station Put in upgrades for towers This will take some of the mindlessness out and add more favor to each run Right now game is redundant and that doesnt create a game you want to keep playing",pos

1485590,This game is straight up fun Im enjoying it a lot,pos
1485590,Game good Much good So many kill bug and blob,pos
1485590,"I probably spent over 200 hours playing Dungeon of the Endless the predecessor and I was extremely hyped about this quasisequel And while I do think it could use some improvements here and there overall I think the game is great and scratches the same itch as the previous version resource management intense combat waves randomized levels give each play through a unique feel etc etc

It may not be as difficult as the previous game and I do wish the metaprogression was more satisfying you can unlock all the characters within the first 67 hours and their relevant quests in the following 5 hours the traits you can apply arent really gamebuild changers That being said Ive enjoyed every minute of it 

I should note Im only playing it on solo and while I could see coop being slightly easier just because switching between characters may doesnt always result in the most efficient pathing the AI is rather smart and they dont seem like a massive hinderance they switch weapons according to the appropriate element type vs enemy they do dodge attacks I do wish there was a way to have them set certain AI behavior ie defend crystal prioritize their health prioritize healingleveling up turrets Otherwise I havent had too much of an issue progressing on solo",pos
1485590,"I have played around 140 hours of Dungeon of the Endless and have been looking forward to Endless Dungeon since it was first announced In my first 10 hours of play for this game I have played a mixture of solo and cooperative play This game does not feel like it was designed primarily for solo play Controlling the AI is cumbersome and defending the different areas of the map is possible but requires a good understanding of how much the AI can do on their own For cooperative play this game is great It gets a lot of hate for the cooperative progression system but the shortcomings are blown out of proportion Now that you can gain characters while in coop there is very little you miss out on by joining someone elses lobby As a sequel to an amazing game I do need to make some comparisons to Dungeon of the Endless

The strategy of this game has been dumbed down from the last one in that there is less resource optimization less choice in research and less required knowledge of different enemies Although now you get more exciting character level ups Dungeon of the Endless was great for solo play the strategy was on point and the tactical pause was great Coop was a bit clunky in how resources were managed and how little you could micromanage the one or two characters you had and without a tactical pause it was easy to suddenly die This game on the other hand is great for coop and okay for solo play

Overall I would recommend the game but especially if you have some friends to play it with",pos

1485590,Refunded due to multiplayer issues,neg
1485590,"This is not a full game It cant be
It was supposed to be a better more beautiful version of Dungeon of Endless with coop
But it is just a cut version of DotE that offers nothing new
The hero roster is half the size of the original
Weapon choices  are a joke pistol rifle SMG bazooka and elemental variations of them
Weapons upgrades  just numbers extra damage extra range etc
3 Heroes party instead of 4 heroes like in the original
Coop  that is not finished or even makes sense  why guests dont progress Why do devs even need a nudge to do it Do they even play RPG coop games Coop does work mechanically  but if you wanna play this game more the one session  it doesnt make sense
The game is beautiful  sure But I did not buy it to watch nice art I was looking for an interesting game

TLDR Better art worse singleplayer mode progressless coop mode",neg
1485590,Its fun but it isnt worth 30 bucks Id say 1215 is even a stretch,neg
1485590,"Not a lot here Feels like a first draft of a decent idea for a game that could oneday come in the future Characters dont feel different or impactful in any way Meta upgrades are small dont do much and are the same across guns 10 fire speed and 25 damage is boring The tower defense is not interesting and doesnt allow you to really make choices Default heavy gun usually out DPSed any of the other guns even when trying for enemy weaknesses

One thing it does have going for it is the style I love how the game looks but again its like a tech demo for a game that might be release in 5 years with actual content and fun systems",neg
1485590,"The game has a fantastic foundation Really it does  its fun snappy and a great system

Right now the game suffers from two big things The lack of proper online coop and variety Missions feel samey very very quickly and the lack of variety in loot is noticeable within the first few hours In time I do think this will be a positive review but not at its current state",neg
1485590,"Less than the sum of its parts sums up this game pretty well

The game feels excellent Shooting the guns and fighting the enemies feels great But it is a tower defense game and regardless of how good the shootybang feels its very limited because you have to devote a lot of attention to setting up watching the progress of and repairing turrets If playing solo you also need to switch over to your AI companions constantly to tell them where to stand Ultimately the most you can do is hold a chokepoint regardless of how good your are at the game as a twinstick shooter

So if you cant really concentrate on the gunplay how is the strategy element

Extremely shallow frankly You need to decide how many turrets are likely to be necessary hoping to save resources for the future However which turrets to build and where is obvious You also need to decide between three upgrades at times but its rare that the choice is difficult and even when it is its not exciting Do you want a 50 upgrade to the speed at which you repair turrets or a 10 upgrade to your damage output These are a significant majority of the games choices

The game is excused for not being a sequel to Dungeon of the Endless but if thats the case why does it still have pretty much all of the same game mechanics but stripped of what made them interesting It is torn between the vision of a strategic resourcemanagement tower defense and an action twinstick shooter But the strategy lacks meaningful choices and the action gives you scant freedom to express your skill and is something youre constantly distracted from

Ill repeat that the game feels excellent A significant overhaul of some of the games systems could turn both sides of the equation golden At that point and with an expansion of the fairly small amount of content in the game this would be one of the very best runbased games out there At present Im disappointed to report that its one of the shallowest instead Its disappointing because it really wouldnt take much change to make that leap",neg
1485590,Fairly fun until the game wont start up abandons your save file or just wont allow for Multiplayer any more  Would avoid until fixed,neg
1485590,"While the visuals sound and atmosphere I find to be pretty stellar  everything else is really really a let down   The gameplay is just so darn lackluster in every department

The issue is that there is nothing to change up each run or really each level for that matter  There are no builds like in a dead cells hades ember knights etc because nothing changes as you play

You will place the same turrets the same generators and see the same weapons everysinglerun without any variations unfortunately  Is this fun for the first 30 minutes  Actuallyyes  The problem is thats the game  Sure it gets harder but you just hold down fire and point until you die or you win  

There are no perks weapons or turrets or combos that break the rules of the game in fun and interesting ways like the best rogues out there  

The bottom line
If youre looking for a great new action rogue you really should sadly move on  Besides it being pretty imho theres not much here that will keep you here  If you like coop it has SLIGHTLY more staying power but man it still gets stale fast  and I havent even mentioned the coop progression issues that the devs commented may be looking into

I think the devs probably made the game they wanted to and it unfortunately is just not one that I find interesting compared to the rest of the choices out there  Disappointing but it happens  Had I not kept it for awhile and played desperately trying to find the fun I probably would have refunded it

Not shared steam success in coop for a coop game should be fixed soon but super super not fun when you want to rush the game like I did
Most weapons are the same with just different elements
 characters are not enough specialist of their domain healer shoud do less damages and heal more supports should support more and do less damages carries are fine tbh
 dont check the merchant its waste of time he always sells useless things not like in dungeon of the endless where it was super satifying to meet him
chests are not satisfying to open at all the loot is so much often bad to take
 No textchat or minimap pings means no communication for a coop game means you dont even want to play coop with strangers
 No server list for multiplayer coop only matchmaking
 Ally AI has super low IQ it can only shoot ennemies and dodge some attacks nothing more
 Ennemy AI attacking generators 1 sec after crystal is in a new slot should not be a normal behavior they should keep focusing crystal bot for the current wave
 If a stranger leaves a coop you cant control the AI that replaces him
 Not enough steam success finish a run in hard or finish the game 1515 times for example

The visuals are great I love DotEs aesthetic and the transition to 3D has been handled well even if I prefer pixel art Areas are dark and foreboding but still have color making them pleasant to look at
