review,voted_up
"Ryzen 5800x3d, RTX 2080, 32GB 3000MHz RAM, Sabrent Rocket NVME (running at PCIE gen 3.0). about 10 hours in 78% done as per the save slot. No crashes plating at 1440p high with DLSS set at quality. Mainly playing at 60FSP with a few dips below during intense scenes and areas. Playing with a DualSense controller and it feels like I am playing the old PS2 games but a good bit faster paced and very clean. If you like Ratchet and Clank and have a good PC its a no brainer.",True
"I hadn't played a Rachet and Clank game since the first few on the PS2, and this brought me back in the best of ways. I really enjoyed the gameplay, leveling up the guns was just as fun as I remember as a kid. Overall a fun time. I got 100% on my only playthrough and very much took my time without guides or solutions, then played a little of the ""Challenge Mode"" (kinda like new game +) before deciding that I had my fill.

I will say that it crashed probably 10-15 times in total, but luckily with the cloud save I was not set back too much. There are a few bugs here and there which were annoying (ex. bosses got stuck invulnerable), but 95% of my gameplay was issue-free. 

I would recommend!",True
"This is from the perspective as somebody who only played the PS2 Trilogy games and now this.

First of all, this game is a graphical masterpiece, and I'm confident with continued patching and more and more powerful GPUs this game will continue to drop jaws for many years to come.  This is both in terms of the technical graphics and the intense level of 3d modeling done for the game.  I ran the game at 4K on a 3080Ti on high settings with relatively little in the way of slowdown.  There were a few crashes but nothing like AMD users seem to be experiencing.

In terms of gameplay, the game definitely fits in line with what I played in the PS2 trilogy.  Though I will say I feel like the weapon variety may have been a bit better in the original trilogy.  Regardless, the weapons here are pretty good, and this is still going to be an excellent entry point for somebody curious about the series.

There are some drawbacks worth pointing out.

First, the sound is just totally busted at this point.  The sounds of the guns are basically not there a majority of the time.  If the sounds do play, they are muted and disjointed.  Dialog plays at the wrong volume constantly.  For all the splendor of the graphics, the sound mixing and overall soundscape is the worst I've seen in a major release in years.  This may get fixed eventually, but jesus.  Also as a fan of the original PS2 trilogy, the music in this is just... nothing.  The music here is generic epic music without much in the way of flair and personality.  There's only a few good tracks and strangely they seem to only play during the end credits.  Total fumble of the ball here.

There's also a few gameplay segments that are just straight bad and add nothing to the game.  Specifically the spider bot hacking segments.  A total cacophony of annoying dialog and convoluted level design.  Who said to themselves that this was needed?  Seems like a total checkbox ticking addition and nothing more.  Just, no.

In terms of the story don't expect a large amount of narrative payoff here.  There's a few good moments, and interesting people to meet but it was pretty lame to end the game without any mention of one of the major plots of the game.  This is almost certainly in the service of setting up things for future games in this set but that doesn't exactly do us on steam much good as we'll likely have to wait an eye-wateringly long time for any sequel to this game to make its way to steam, if we're even that lucky.

Anyway, these drawbacks aside, the game is definitely worth a play.  Especially if you have a powerful computer and an overstuffed nvidia GPU.  This is the new Crysis in terms of how far you can push the graphics and benchmarking.  Would definitely recommend now, even with the launch issues, though you may want to give it a few months.

Was a good time,True
"Great iteration in the series, looking forward to NG+",True
Rivet is frkin adorable 10/10,True
Great game! Really fun. Will take you about 16-18 hours to 100%. Only issues I ran into is some crashes (It crashed around 5 times in my 18 hours of game time) and the minimap not being completely exact and annoying to use (It's a bit off in some locations and the fog-of-war uncovery radius is jokingly small),True
"Reminds me of growing up playing these games. Absolutely loved it. You do get stuck on geometry now and then, but otherwise, solid, fun, humorous game!!!",True
Great game but lets get those crash fixes please.,True
"Granted I've been stoned the whole time, this games pretty damn fun.",True
"Another solid entry in the series, and I am really happy that this came to the PC!!!",True
"This game was such an enjoyable experience, everything from the movement to the combat to the visual style is just perfect. A real showoff for higher end GPUs, never seen a game look like this before. Great performance all around, with only some minor tweaks to be made for the future.",True
v fun,True
"This review is negative, it's merely marked as positive for having a faint remnant aesthetic to a long dead and glorious franchise.

I'm 18 hours in and bored. Starting with the loss of the T rating and gaining an E10+, the game ditches the series adult humor in favor of adding two new female protagonists that ""equally"" parallel our hero's. Thus the downfall begins.

Lack of motivation or any solid story telling leaves this game to depend on game play alone. Unfortunately the game play is only okay with features and level design that are just weak. All too often I would see an area and maneuver my way up to the spot in question only to discover that there was a specifically laid out path to it. In one case I did an entire secret area in reverse with growing excitement until I got to the end and realized it was the start. Lame.

With no signature adult humor the game is forgettable and bland, actually looking worse as you get further in. Levels feel like throwaways with either hyper linear corridors or in one case literally a giant slab of dusty rock to ""explore"". You rarely even have to explore because the map shows you every collectible you've even breathed the same air as, though that leaves you to wonder why you don't have a radar. Instead having to pause the action every five seconds to see where the next bolt or raritanium cache is. Invisible walls on some areas but not others, instant kill here but not there, high quality textures right next to low quality ones. It's an inconsistent mess.

Then you start noticing the suddenly ""NEW"" direction the series has decided to take with the incorporation of an almost 80% female background cast and the total emasculation of the existing male characters who either don't say much or seem to be paper thin stand-ins for politics, and the not so subtle increase in political correctness. Don't believe me? Lets have a look at what's in the game.

Minor Spoilers ahead.

Clank loses an arm and spouts several lines about how its important to accept yourself as you are and how ""I'm happier this way""

Rivet is missing an arm and her and Clank ""Bond"" over their disfigurement like he can't get a new one.

Mr. Zurkon is a pacifist who refuses to let people have weapons.

Zurkon Jr. is anti establishment.

Ms. Zurkon is described by the wiki as ""life partner"" and is conveniently lacking a Mrs, implying she doesn't need a man.

There's a painful interactive song about how pirates must sing songs about fair women in ""respectable positions of power""

There's a repetitive hacking mini game that must be done by yet another female character instead of ratchet where upon she starts to act out the tearing down of {A corrupt system} and how she is the only one who can do it.

Ratchet is hyper touchy feely and insecure now.

Almost every NPC you interact with is female.

One weapon changes gender pronouns from male to female as it's upgraded.

The male NPC's are either stupid, neurotic, or weak [mentally or physically]

All humor has been replaced with Nu Saints Row style ""humor"". One joke is literally something like ""oh my god I can't tell the difference between a bucket and a head...haha...we should kill you for defiling a corpse"" You're not laughing? well neither was I.

In short it's another morally corrupt game aimed at selling a political ideology instead of just having fun. I haven't even finished it yet and it's just a chore.",True
"Great game, great story, a very worthy entry to the franchise. I wish there was racing and ship flying, and I wish the arena was more developed.

The higher end PC you have, the less performance issues there will be. I see plenty of people mentioning crashes, but I only had minor stuttering during only a few zone changes and zero crashes. 2080ti and i9-9900K, 16g RAM",True
"I NEED HELP GAME KEEPS CRASHING 
",True
"Game crashes too much. its good, but there are deffinitely a lot of crashes. Including sliding off of invisible objects, and instant deaths if you hit specific corners. specifically on pirate ships I died many times due to instant deaths of hitting corners.",True
My favorite childhood game is now back better than ever. I could not be happier!!!,True
Bring all Ratchet and Clank games to PC!,True
"I know Ratchet and clank has been playstation exclusive it's entirety until now, So i've only played the ps2 games. But once this dropped on pc I snagged it instantly. Plays great. Graphics are amazing. Weapons are sicks! upgrade system is sick! bosses are hard. it's just fun. definitely buy it",True
"im  on my 14 crash in this 3 hours... all for the low price of 60 dollars...
",False
"So I am a huge Ratchet and Clank fan, and I cannot in good faith recommend this to anyone. The game is so poorly optimized, I've fallen out of bounds multiple times, and the game has skipped cut-scenes locking me out of progression.",False
"Great game but PC port crashes a lot.
RTX 4090/13700k/64 GB DDR5",False
"I can't recommend the game until they patch the issue with crashing. Performance-wise, the game actually runs great. The problem is that smooth gameplay currently only lasts about 30-60 minutes before you crash to desktop. Sometimes you can send a report, sometimes you can't. Sometimes it blames a driver, sometimes it doesn't. 

If you're a fan of Ratchet & Clank, its a good game. Wait till they fix the issues.",False
"Needs alot of patches and work done, a pretty poor port in its current condition 

Will update my review when/if it gets fixed",False
"I've noticed I get severe fps drops when there are a lot of particles. It always happens when I hit an enemy with the Enforcer or when I put a lot of bullets on a boss with the pistol. When I shoot my frame rate drops dramatically from 110 to 30 or even 24 (my graphics card is RTX 3070 and Ray Tracing is disabled, I use an SSD and the latest Nvidia driver). You can be running around just fine but combat or simply firing your weapons can tank your frame rate. This occurs even if you set the game to the lowest quality. I'm getting tired of this so I will probably put this game on hold and wait until they fix it. This game will probably be in a better shape in a few weeks. Currently we're just doing another round of beta testing for another crappy, unfinished PC port.",False
Played 5 hours and the day after the game crashes every 5 min of gameplay.,False
Really enjoyable game when its running properly but the game constantly crashes anywhere between 5 minutes of game play up to an hour. Even with running the graphics and everything else on the lowest possible settings. Until this is fixed I would not recommend buying this game.,False
"They've released the game too early. It isn't optimised properly so it crashes with no warning a few minutes into gameplay. My Laptop is fine other games, can run MW2, Elden Ring, etc. with no issues. Game needs to fixed before others should spend this much money on it.",False
"The game itself is super fun. However, it crashes a TON on PC. Like at least once an hour, if not more often. Im running an i7 and 1080ti, 32gb ram. Im sure itll get better",False
I've wanted to play this for so long but never had a playstation - unfortunately I've struggled to make progress because the game crashes so frequently it becomes no fun to try in my free time,False
"This is a fun shooter, albeit very easy even on the hardest difficulty due to the strength of the weaponry. The characters and gameplay are great but at this time the port is absolutely shocking. This game has serious issues with streaming and audio loading along with consistent failure to load scenes. Even on a PCIE M.2. every scene failed to load the speech audio correctly leading to out of sync audio for the first few lines, an issue which was present in the console version.

For example, loading into the arena is a 50/50 chance of not loading your character location, leading to falling off the map and having to try again. Luckily this game has constant checkpoints and saves all gained collectables.

Though I 100% and enjoyed this game, I cannot honestly recommend this port as it stands.",False
the game itself im enjoying but i cant give it a good review as the game crashes so so much like all other sony ports this port sucks ass and is too buggy,False
Game is very fun but it's a crashing mess. Hope they fix it,False
"Main desktop PC - First initial levels played fine. Not looking forward to the mid-game, looking at the comments. 

My modern gaming laptop with a 4070 cannot get past the demanding Sony Entertainment screen. 

I'd say to be wary of the initial purchase.",False
still crashing within 40 seconds,False
"I'm going to preface this by saying the game is good, but I would not recommend while it's listed at full price.

I want to rate this game positively, I really do. But it is INCREDIBLY short, especially with a $80 price tag attached to it. Was able to 100% save my first run through the game in just 12 hours, on the second highest difficulty.

The planet levels themselves are relatively short, and (at least to my memory) are a lot more linear than previous titles. Levels have very little replayability, and the majority of which you can go through and get all the collectibles without any of the exploration gadget unlocks, along with them mostly being adjacent to the main path.

If you can get the game for 50-75% off, I'd say it is worthwhile. But, and especially compared to their older titles, you just aren't getting a lot of game for your dollar.",False
performance issues. stutterfest,False
"Great game, but it crashes so much seemingly at random on my RX 7900 XT even with dynamic resolution and raytracing off. If you own an AMD graphics card, I'd recommend waiting this one out to be honest, can't really recommend it in it's current state. Once they iron out the crashes, I'll recommend it.",False
"This game is completely unplayable on PC. It crashes after about 15 minutes of play time. I have all of the latest drivers, my graphics are set to the lowest possible settings, I verified all of my game files, and I have 64 GB of RAM, a 3080 graphics card, and an i9 11900K CPU. Fix the game and I will change my review.",False
