730,"Have you ever taken a hiatus from CSGO only to return to a gaming nightmare I certainly have and let me tell you its an experience that can be both frustrating and disheartening

Picture this you step away from the world of CounterStrike for a couple of years fully immersing yourself in the real world You build a life gather experiences and grow as a person But the gaming itch eventually beckons you back and you decide to revisit your old stomping grounds in CSGO Little did you know that your triumphant return would be met with an unexpected and unpleasant surprise

Upon reentering the game you find yourself thrust into Silver ranks Yes Silver  a far cry from where you once stood among the elites The gameplay feels foreign and you wonder if youve forgotten everything you knew about CSGO But youre determined to regain your former glory to polish those rusty skills and climb back to your rightful rank

However the path to redemption is fraught with challenges As you slowly but surely begin to regain your skills you start to notice something unsettling Youre frequently pitted against players who seem utterly clueless about the nuances of the game They spray wildly miss easy shots and often lack basic game sense Its not their fault  they are Silver players after all But heres the kicker theyre convinced youre smurfing or cheating

Your old account adorned with years of hardearned badges and accolades has now become a target The Silver players you face cant fathom the possibility of a onceskilled player returning to their ranks They cry foul and report you for smurfing or hacking and they do so with fervor And what happens next You guessed it  you receive a ban

Its a grim reality of the CSGO community In their zeal to maintain a level playing field some players and the system itself can be merciless to those who dare to reclaim their former glory The hours spent playing fairly the dedication to the game over the years  it all seems to be for naught when faced with the wrath of the Silver ranks

In the end its a sobering reminder that the CSGO landscape can be unforgiving especially to returning players So if youre planning to make a triumphant comeback after a hiatus be prepared for the challenges that await But remember its not just about ranks and bans its about the passion and love for the game that keeps us coming back despite the odds gg wp",neg

1716740,"About 5545 on this one when a title like this comes out that I really want I make sure NOT to read spoilers etc There wont be any here The one thing I kept hearing was to focus on the main quest as the REAL end game content is much better once you are through it While everything was fun and it gave me a little Mass Effect 1 feel combined with a little bit of Falloutishit is still lacking severely in some areas that I was actually shocked to see from Bethesda Some of the greatest elements from Fallout 4 were gone Here you are in space exploring planets building outposts doing the settlement thing that made Fallout 4 great for meyet you dont get a settlement here You just buildand accumulate until someone comes out with a mod that jumpstarts the game again

 I wished I had done the side missions the base building the exploring the leveling etc as I progressed the first play through I have 16hrs in the game with the main quest doneand honestly I find myself getting bored after about an hour If Bethesda had allowed you create an empire through settlements have a fleet have some sort of end game that keeps you goingor tons of hidden discoveries or events then I would say all these years in the making was more justified 

 One thing I will say for once they released a game that is pretty solid with very minor issues I am hoping a patch will fix a few little things So good job on putting a game out with some quality behind it",pos

1716740,"I really like this game It has a lot of positives and negatives though

Positives 
 Great single player first person shooter
 Tons to explore
 Building Mode 20
Negatives
 Feels like Space Fallout
 Main quest was underwhelming and frankly a little bit boring I feel like they could have done so much more with it Intentionally being vague to not put spoilers
 Faction quests were lack luster They were alright but I felt like they could have been longer and more detailed I knew the culprit for FreeStar rangers as soon as I met him Ryujin was bleh Cool unlock at the end though As of writing this review I have not done the UC or Crimson Pirates hoping they arent as bad
 Too easy I started the game on hard and after my 3rd unity I bumped it to very hard it just doesnt seem that difficult Wheres survival mode Theres food drinks and beds it should be an option maybe in the expansion
 Tons of useless items Kinda ties into above Food and drink items are worthless even in the beginning Ive never needed the boost from any of the chems and all of the additional treatment packs are basically pointless I believe Ive used one to treat poison on my first play through Once you level a bit they all become pointless
 No alien races Everyone is human or a form of human avoiding spoiler Big missed opportunity here for tons of different species imo

Overall I still really like the game and the idea of New Game There are a few good side quests but with the size of this game I was honestly expecting a lot more

810",pos
1716740,"I liked most of the game so far gun combat  spaceship design but its got a lot of problems

I think it might be better to play with no companions because they are so incredibly dumb both in combat and conversation

It doesnt feel like space travel because its just a fast travel menu Contrast with Cyberpunk where I dont even fast travel because the city is amazing even after 100 hours 

I dont get to explore and accidentally run into a big questline in the wild like SkyrimFallout",pos
1716740,Unfortunately its a Bethesda game The good news is that its a Bethesda game,pos

1716740,Bethesda game Slightly buggy but hundreds of hours of playable encounters  Patches will come,pos
1716740,i think its a great game not perfect by any viewpoint for sure classic BGS bugs but the down voting and trashing of the game is pretty unnecessary if you really want to play a game dont rely on websites nobodies and loud mouthed streamers for experience just try it yourself,pos
1716740,Awesome game Im not into single player games much anymore but if your a fan of Fallout titles andor Elite Dangerous youll not be disappointed Loot endless spawns of planet landings and outposts or jump from system to system engaging in hours of ship combat  Just remember to skill up the weightlifting perk and ship cargo capacity lol,pos

1716740,good game,pos
1716740,1010,pos
1716740,"I will mention I have beaten the game On very hard in case thats relevant The entire gameplay loop consists of going from point A to point B to do a thing usually to just talk to someone or deliver an item with random generic copy paste raider battles in between here and there I think I have literally engaged in the exact same copy paste spaceland battles well over 100 times and there is load screens every two minutes even in areas that makes literally no sense such as two small different sectors that are sidebyside but are half the size and half as dense as other larger sectors that are a single whole map

 hijacking ships though part of the game technically is utterly useless and pointless because the amount of credits you get from hijacking ships is basically nothing Also you cannot store and swap ship parts like you can probably on any other ship game there is so that entire mechanic is basically worthless and also makes buying ship parts relatively worrisome to some degree because after you buy a ship part if you replace a prior ship part you also lose that thing so if you plan on switching to a different ship or upgrading your current one but also maybe you want to go back and keep your lower grade weapons as a secondary weapon system or whatever else well youre gonna have to buy that all over again
and sidenote anytime you edit your ship or switch home ships such as to hijack another ship or something like that if you had a nice beautiful set up armory I hope you werent too attached to it cause all of that stuff its just gonna get reset and youre gonna have to replace it all over again even if you never modified the armory module itself or even the any of the modules directly connected to it so the fact that theres a nice armory where you can display everything is basically also useless because every time you modify your ship or change home ships by hijacking another it will all disappear and youll have to reset it all over again

outpost building is borderline worthless settlements aside from creating one on a certain planet that has nickel and cobalt so you can just craft infinite magnets for infinite moneyXP thats really the only thing its good for Also the very story itself revolves around going into new game plus but theres literally no way to carry over any of your weapons or armor or anything else so if you just got a really unique weapon you absolutely love dont get attached to it cause youre gonna have to go and get that weapon over and over and over again and if you get a random God roll well definitely dont get attached because good luck ever finding it again which sidenote makes extra no sense when you realize that your star born ship actually follows you through the multiverse so why cant I just store whatever I want a new game plus with into the cargo hold of the ship and have it carryover I should absolutely be able to do that It makes no sense I cant

Oh yeah something else I remembered unlike in no mans sky you cant free fly to a planet and away from the planet like they tried to make it sound in the marketing if you actually take the time to fly all the way until you reach a planet youll just go right through it because theyre actually just papiermch textures and you cannot fly in and out of atmosphere directly You have to manually select the planet select where to land and when you land on the planet you have a limited area to explore that is procedurally generated 

and in the year 2023 Bethesda games still do not have fucking vehicles so actually exploring these areas can be incredibly boring and monotonous this game is horribly mid I honestly do not understand why anyone actually enjoys it much less says its gonna be a game of the year runnerup this game compared to Hogwarts or tears of the Kingdom never mind baldurs gate three If it wasnt for the fact that I have no doubt the modding community will make this game far more enjoyable in about a year or two after all of the good mods and DLC and what not have had time to come out I wouldve demanded a refund day one but luckily I have faith in the modding community but none in Bethesda anymore 

Which reminds me I would like to remind everyone that this game was originally slotted to come out two or three years ago it was only delayed because Microsoft obtained Bethesda if this is the current state of the game now imagine the state it was in when they were intentionally planning on initially releasing it to us Yea so big thanks to Microsoft I guess for making Bethesda give us a mid 510 game instead of an entirely unplayable 210 piece of trash

Oh two final notes 1 regarding the perk system as well it is horribly implemented My character recently got to level 62 and I still do not have a single perk into any combat abilities whatsoever and barely into any social or athletic abilities either almost every perk you spend assuming you wanna actually access the full game is going to be spent exclusively in science and tech until youre 60 because for some reason there are a ton of core gameplay mechanics that are locked behind not only perks but perks with four levels each so if you wanna unlock the ability to craft things to unlock things to modify your ship properly your space suit properly and so on unlike in prior fallout games like new Vegas and three were you just get a single perk and now you have full access to that crafting tree now youre gonna be level 60 before you can put a single perk point in to literally anything else 

And 2 new game plus and star born powers were implemented horribly as priorly mention you cant carry items over so if you get a random God roll you just lose it and youre screwed Theres no way around that so far outside of maybe some mods which hopefully come out to fix that But on top of that the star born powers have to be obtained one by one so rather than you start a new game plus and then you get a full list of 24 locations where you have to go to find each next level of each power you instead have to find one go back to talk to Vladimir head out grab another one go back to talk to Vladimir and repeat that process 24 times per play through each star born power goes up to a level of 10 so if you want to max out your starborn powers you have to do all of that 240 times were talking hours and hours potentially even days spent doing literally nothing but fast traveling from one point to another killing a starborn doing a map and repeating over and over and over again 240 times I dont know what moron at Bethesda thought that was a good game play mechanic or loop but they need to be fired What should happen is in new game Plus you get a list of all the locations that also list exactly which abilities are at which location so you know which locations you want to go to first or better yet your powers will just naturally upgrade with each new game plus so you dont have to spend two hours jumping around the entire fucking galaxy to go to a handful of temples over and over and over again 240 times just to max out your starborn powers 

As I said when you look at this game in the whole of the gaming landscape its a midlevel game its not 100 trash The game does work Mostly its just severely disappointing barebones And lacking features However if I were to judge this game by other space based games and AAA RPG Standerds I would actually give this game a 310 you get one point for actually having a story you get another for being mostly bug free and you get a third for having your ship and combat mechanics actually function But thats it everything else about this game is bare minimum monotonous grindy repetitive and boring 

Oh and btw another reminder In the year 2023 they still cant implement body slide in character creator a mod available to Skyrim over 10 years ago",neg
1716740,"honestly this is just no man sky
the worlds feel amazingly empty aswell as all of the cities in the game have no map so you just wander around them hoping to find somthing cool and when you do you probably wont be able to find it again with out autistically roaming around the city not knowing where to go
cool concept",neg
1716740,"Overall a great game but too many bugs at this stage With approx 50 hours in the latest game and having reached level 16 none of the guns would fire Checked many recommendations on the web In short it recommended I go get a Masters degree in Computer Programming

Would wait another year for the bugs to be fixed before purchasing",neg

1716740,"I have been waiting for that feeling to hit me You know the one That feeling of enchantment and awe stricken wonder that comes with a game like Oblivion Skyrim or Fallout 3 however it remains just out of reach As I round every corner and fast travel to every system I find myself in a state of anticipation that never ends There are some wonderful quests that genuinely surprised me and yet it all feels so barren Maybe thats the point A thousand planets A thousand vistas of nothingness A few crowned jewels here and there ripe with life Maybe there is beauty in that Sure interspersed here and there are points of interest on these desolate rocks An abandoned mining outpost abandoned pharmaceutical labs but it all just feels like so much of the same Even those jewels feels sparse with low biodiversity and minimal points of interest

Herein lies the rub Its nothing Strings of generated code to give you the perception that there is in fact something You will search and search and search yearning for that awe inspiring moment Youll find a few interesting quests scattered throughout just to barely satiate that hunger for more deep inside you Youll continue to search for it That period in the game when you finally think to yourself This is it This is why Im here playing this game I love this The more I wander the less I feel Its lonely It feels hollow I feel hollow This game is so vast in scope and scale I almost believed in it I thought that surely this would be the quintessential space RPG I was let down Even now I think to myself that if I just keep exploring from planet to planet surely I will find it I just have to keep going I will find a quest that world space where everything just clicks If I keep pushing and delve further I will find it Certainly I must

Nothing A remnant of a time long past A once small development team with ambition has blossomed into the company we know today Fallout 4 concerned me Fallout 76 infuriated me Starfield bores me Its regression disguised as progression",neg
1716740,This game is empty shallow boringI am no longer looking forward to ES6,neg
1716740,Wait a few more years when there is more content added to the game and bugs are fixed Look how long it took Cyberpunk and NMS to get right Same applies to this game sadly,neg
1716740,As a long time Bethesda fan I was rather disappointed with this game There is a lot of game here and a lot of different main and side quests The ship building and base building are fun but get boring after a while The whole space battle aspect is quite empty and boring where I try to stay out of the ship as much as possible Not sure why they thought they needed as many planets as they do most of them are you just running around an empty planet for a couple hours trying to find something to do I feel like the worst part is the lack of exploration needed to complete the game In Skyrim you need to physically go to the location before you can teleport there which most times youll find a cave or a  town to explore and get distracted by But in this game its you get the questteleport to the shipteleport to the quest locationkill the 20 guys in the building and then reverse the whole thing to go back The amount of time you spend in loading screens is crazy considering how fast they load On the positive side the characters and backstorys are well done in this game There is a huge assortment of guns and armor The gunplay overall is pretty great in comparison to fallout But the game was a pretty big letdown from the kings at Bethesda Would only recommend if you get it for free,neg
1716740,"Two things one really big problem
I dont care at all for Bethesda bringing in real life culturalsocial aspects into a single player video game when youre trying to escape from it I wont mention the feature because it seems theyre going after anyone who mentions it and cant take criticism for it and are silencing anyone who mentions that for a game you bought and OWN you should be able to turn it off and keep the malefemale options as previous bethesda games have always had

Also the GAME BREAKING BUGS are a HUGE problem Im 90 hours in and Ive had to stop playing because theyve completely spoiled my play through A few questsbugs Ill go ahead and mention that have broke for me Main quest line Powers from Beyond and old neighborhood venus part I also can no longer have crew on any of my ships because of a bug with the door that made it inaccessible The amount of bugs is insane and it really couldve used another few months of polishing Overall people getting bannedmuted from threads discords etc for wanting to turn off a feature in a game THEY OWN is ridiculous and the game breaking bugs are very difficult to overcome even with the use of console comands",neg
1716740,"Super unintuitive and clunky  Even by Bethesda standards which are dropping year by year

Bethesda really needs to get people who play video games to help design the menus here",neg
1716740,"just another bethesda rpg if you like to call them that

space exploration game that you dont explore in
menus are frustrating dont show important basic info and require more button pressespage shuffling than necessary in 2023

bad optimization and need for mods aside it feels like a game from 2011 that was overhyped back then too",neg
1716740,"This is like Outer Worlds except worse Its also very graphic demanding the CEO wasnt joking when talking about upgrading your PC to play this game

Its just not optimized you can tell by going from low to high settings without much change in FPS",neg
1716740,A mostly fun game filled to the brim with bugs and technical issues After finally finishing my first playthrough I cant help but feel a little disappointed The exploration in this game is terrible I do not think that I found any new location while free roaming after the first 1015 hours A majority of the locations are tied to quest lines which is really unfortunate Will gladly jump back in for another go after some patches and DLC comes out but for now I am glad my time is done,neg
1716740,"I gave this game 60 hours so I think I have spent enough time to have a thoughtful opinion Much of the time I spent was with the hope that I was building toward a memorable and engaging gameplay system 

That never occurred At no time in that 60 hours did I even feel like I was on the cusp of the good part I stopped playing a few days ago and have had no urge to continue 

My conclusion is that this game added nothing to my gaming world I never played this game and thought This is great
At best it  is mediocre and passable if there are no other games to play This game isnt a swing and a miss in truth there was never a swing It is just the Creative Engine showing us what is cannot do",neg
1716740,garbage,neg
1716740,Very little explanation for systems within the game Also found it to be very boring early on,neg
1716740,With how this has turned out im really really scared how TES6 will turn out Not to mention the remaster of oblivion,neg
1716740,About 18 hours into the game Starfield started crashing every 510 minutes Its completely unplayable at this point I have an RTX 3080 clean driver install and I reinstalled the game Nothing works Total garbage,neg
1716740,"As much as Id like to say I recommend this I dont at least not at its current state and price Starfield is more Bethesda The good and the bad Some things have improved while others have gotten worse or actively refused to progress Positives first

There is a HUGE improvement here that I longed for in both Skyrim and FO4 faction quests Faction quests in previous Bethesda releases were shallow affairs where you rose to the top of your chosen faction within maybe five or six quests Starfield tries and mostly succeeds at returning to the roots of Morrowind and Oblivion you have to work your way up gradually Faction quest writing is mostly good and makes you want to see whats next Each faction has specific mission boards so if you want more content after the storyline you have endless radiant quests to play through And these are generally fun 
Notably roleplay is improved from FO4 mostly thanks to the lack of a voice actor for the main character There are a lot of opportunities to just be YOUR character especially once youre familiar with the world building 

So why dont I recommend it 
Well theres a lot to dig through Starfield is fun Its even a good game But almost everything about it just makes me wish I was playing an older Bethesda release Base building is more shallow than FO4 as is weapon customization NPCs no longer follow schedules While there are fun  unique quests the game is bloated with proc gen worlds that serve to pad out actual POIs World reactivity is oddly rare or entirely missing Itemization is awful with 90 of weapon drops favoring a ballistic build If you want energy weapons or melee I hope you enjoy less content 
Further Bethesda quality of writing isnt really great here It pales in comparison to recent releases like Cyberpunk 2077 or RDR2 
I like this game I really do The mainline story has a more interesting execution than either FO4 or Skyrim The gunplay is great The music is good and will be nostalgic in half a decade just like Jeremy Soules music in older TES games 
But man I feel like Bethesda really cut corners when they couldve made strides forward 

Buy the game on sale or wait for more content to be released for it Its a good game truly but its nothing revolutionary and if youre absolutely craving a new Bethesda world I think youre still better playing an old release or waiting for a sale Ill revise this review as I play moremore content releases",neg
1716740,look dont get me wrong i like the game i think its cool and all that but HOLY FUCK ITS STANDING SIM I CANT EVEN WALK FOR 2 MINS WITHOUT NEEDING TO STOP AND CATCH MY BREATH LIKE WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT WE LIVING IN LIKE 3000 AND YOU CANT WALK A GOD DAMN BLOCK WITHOUT NEEDING TO STOP AND CATCH YOUR BREATH PLEASE FUCKING REMOVE OR AT LEAST FIX THIS STUPID ASS SHIT,neg

Example
A goblin priestess tried to trick me and kill me

The goblin priestess calls guards
I am forced to kill everyone including guards
After the battle I am labeled Enemy of Justice
Every guard of every race in every town now hates me and starts fights automatically which in turn pulls every NPC of that townarea into battle against me
I can not complete any quests because I am forced to kill everyone in the entire game because I killed one goblin guard in a battle I did not even initiate
There is literally no fix for this you are forced to start a new character or load a save from 5 hours ago
Google it goblin enemy of justice bug there are THOUSANDS

Example 2
My character died
There is an NPC that revives people for money
For some reason that NPC has no dialoge to revive my character
Whats the fix Save the game infront of the Reviver load a save where your character was alive then load the save you just made THEN the option appears

Act 2 was great fine which was a surprise how good it was then act 3 where it just slows down the pacing with cut scene after cut scene Some the quests werent much important in the story or journey it was just there to max your level up which is fine but having all that and little importance Sure you might get a unquie weapon but you just be googling the weapons and armor on a website at this point Since the drops are rng with mobs some anyway it just be save scuming as they call it 

I say playing on tactician isnt much great for players to experience Cause you have to deal with little more hp with enemies and more damage they do Which also during the battle it can sometimes take forever for enemies to do something Sometimes the animation doesnt play much cause the AI is trying to figure out how to kill you Sure you might think it can be human like But if the AI focus is melee only They should not take 10 secs to figure out what to do next if they cant reach their target I played other turn base games and they have more fluid and more action than waiting around Sure its nice to be able to do a turn but when the AI does it well it just be sometimes it figuring out what to do next when they stop and stare at one the characters 

Reason why people have so many hours into this is not from the cut scenes Its from the turn base battle where you have to wait till the AI does something and the more AI there more time you have to wait around But that be a game for players who dont have much reaction time and just want to smack things and see what happens after",neg
1086940,"It is such a great game But in its current state I cannot recommend due to how horny the NPCs are it ruins the experience with its over the top sexualization and something needs to be done about it so as a player i do not feel borderline sexually assualted by some of those characters coming on so strong First play through i somehow entered into a relationship with Gale by going to his stupid magic show and he broke up with me after i entered into a relationship with SH while having to turn down Halsin who randomly confessed his love for me and rejecting both the vampire and Lazeal 

Second playthrough i spoke 3 times to Wyll ad he invites me to a romantic dance and again Lazeal All of this feels extremely bizarre and inorganic This really is a shame because the oversexualization takes a lot away from the game and made the NPCs more or less sexual objects 

Not all of us enjoy over the top sexual elements in our video games  i have pornhub for that and Larian really took that away from us players who want nothing but going on a adventure with a bunch of cool companions and not having to deal with excessive sexual advances from characters that i perceive as appalling Halsin for example  at all times

And for those who think this isnt an issue  Larian admitted themselves that horny NPCs are due to  bug and not to game design",neg

1086940,"Judging by the vast amount of simpery for this game were gonna need a negative review because this game is FAR from perfect and some of the oversights are just plain embarrassing Lets do this

 AI pathing in BG3 is the worst Ive ever seen in any game  even Mass Effect did a better job AI party members will go almost immediately face first into harmful terrain if youre not manually directing them Then sometimes youll walk into a fight only to realize a party member got stuck somewhere a half mile away severally hurting your chances of survival Other times theyll even say stand under a descending lift and get crushed to death instantly

 Random outofnowhere boss fights will screw you over quite often forcing you to reload from a past save that may end up erasing hours of gameplay and characterinventory management Autosaving in general is pretty spotty  I recommend downloading a Nexus mod that autosaves before every fight

 Darkest Dungeon style lol u missed All damaging moves feel like they only hit half of the time

 The AI often lags when ordered to attack and does nothing for several seconds ie Astarion trying to sneak stab and then it will simply skip the animation to produce the effect

 Game doesnt pause when tabbing out and you cant pause during the enemys turn

 Having to stop the entire flow of gameplay to rest at camp is annoying  its just a needless arbitrary chore that shouldnt be in the game to begin with

 Random RNG skill checks directly encourage savescumming which in itself trivializes the mechanic Why have them beyond the lol muh dee en dee novelty

 The entire interface is a nightmare to navigate Its like looking a switchboard and will take several hours of gameplay until it starts becoming legible

 Camera panningrotating moves at a snails pace I cant help but think Im free when leaving the game and realizing that a PC doesnt actually run this sloppy

 Full of irritating bugs and oversights For example I picked up a dead mind flayer tadpole in Act 2 thinking it might have some importance down the line It didnt so in Act 3 I dropped it in a shop The shopkeeper immediately became hostile and one party member was downed and imprisoned in the ensuing fight which took 20 minutes of pointless escape attempts before I was forced to have the entire party break them out Its like Larian never actually playtested their game to keep irritating irrational situations like these from happening",neg

1971870,"Mortal Kombat is the first video game franchise I ever truly fell in love with so it pains me to say this but this game is heavily heavily flawed lacks in basic QoL features weve come to expect from both the MK franchise and the fighting game genre and frankly feels unfinished

The single player content is mostly quite bad The seasonal invasion fights are not remotely fun at all Customization has been severely gimped since 11 most characters only have 2 skins and then a bunch of colours There is all sorts of random features lacking like the ability to pin moves on the screen during training mode and the ability to change your characters costume on the character select screen something so simple that requires the opening of an entirely separate menu The online also has a lot of problems you cant make your own rooms loading screens taking forever inability to filter out wifi warriors and more lag then youd expect from MK Everything about the game in terms of content feels rushed 

For more subjective stances the character design ranges from excellent to godawful with Tanya easily being the most butchered and most others falling into the bland category Megan Fox voice acts a character people have been asking to return for 15 years and gives the worst most uninterested sounding performance Ive heard in a triple AAA game destroying the immersion every time shes on screen The story mode is better than MK11 but still has a lot of problems Scorpion and SubZero conflict is very lukewarm probably the biggest letdown for me the villains are as usual portrayed as pathetic jokes and Im convinced whoever came up with the ending was likely on crack What disappoints me most however was that despite this being a fresh start for the franchise with the new era and all the game devolves into a direct sequel to the plot of MK11 and leans extremely heavily into the multiverse and timeline convergence garbage The gothic dark atmosphere of older MKs is largely absent as it has been for a while now Im afraid and what we get in its place feels more akin to marvel with gore than Mortal Kombat Everything about this games story character designs and presentation feels stale safe and corporate a far cry from classic MK which did not concern itself with catering to mainstream expectations 

The reason I dont score the game lower is because the combat system and gameplay is mostly very good and a massive step up from MK11 However I would not recommend this game to anyone who is not interested in exploring aspect to its full potential playing online against other people the single player experience is absolutely not worth it It hurts to say but I do not feel this product nor its developers are respectful of their audience",pos

1971870,The game is imKomplete with basically zero single player content  For a fighting game thats normally fine But MK has set a standard of having at least something decent  The game performs HORRIBLY on PC and you will need a high end GPU to play on anything but LOW and get 60 FPS  Gameplay is typical NRS trash horribly unbalanced and gimmicky  Bug ridden lag fest  In a year with Fighting Games like SF6 Tekken 8 coming out and ARCSYS titles like DBFZ and GGstrive still being supported  You cant really justify buying this game let alone putting time into it  The normal low IQ MK sycophants who dont know what frames are and have never stepped foot in a training mode will eat it up  And dont even get me started there  If you enjoy labbing set ups and using the training dummy the myriad of qualify of life issues will have you wanted to fatality yourself in 5 minutes  Save your time and money,neg

1971870,"MK1 gets a 210

UNORIGINAL STORY

starting off the story is basically a retelling of Mortal Kombat 11 with different details As a fan of MK series I wanted something fresh which this game marketed itself as but no we get a retelling of mk11 with the character mix matched Very disappointing New graphic dont make up for shit story telling

Combat sucks

Where do i began the combat literally sucks dick plain and simple i continually kept doing missions over to have practice because the AI characters are all so easy to beat on hard mode id redo the mission with the same character im playing simple on the fact that the story rushes you and you fight with a character 3 times before moving onto a new one not even learning the character what so ever nor does any of the characters have combos the combos id get were far from special furthermore the story is a short and rushed at a mere 6 hoursthats right6 hour story I really struggled to find enjoyment when these game studios go for dlc and purchasable content for multiplayer rather then tailor their game to a wide audience that can enjoy the story and the multiplayer in the same game rather then focus on one and abandon the other 

This is a regression in the MK Series
this game is a mess compared to MK11 and MK10 in conclusion i struggle to find myself wanting to play more of it From the characters being shells of themselves to the combat reflecting the shells of what could have been the best MK installment in the series Very disappointing",neg
1971870,Unfinished  rushed product I have been fan on MK since sega days and dont remember being this disappointed in my entire life with the franchise DO NOT buy this game at the current stage I trust Ed Boons word when he said we worked on this game the longest and it will show but it was just another lie to sell their product sadly There is too many bugs lack of customization cut content glitches ping  fps issues but none of the devs said anything about the issues so far they are just being radio silent pretending game is perfect so it doesnt hurt the sales,neg
1971870,The overall gameplay for MK1 is pretty fun Characters gain access to more special moves now that they arent variations and being able to only select three additional special moves eg MK11 However with the gameplay being fun the online play for the game is abysmal There are frame rate drops to stutters as well as having desyncs against your opponent if you want to rematch them I dont understand how this game released as is the online is horrible if you want to keep playing online  you basically have to keep finding new opponents after winning or losing after one match Havent really tried invasion nor story mode but if your mostly play online like I do I would probably hold off buying this game for now At least until NRS releases a big fix to fix these issues,neg
1971870,I have been waiting for this game for a while but I have to give a negative review cause unfortunately it brought on only the things I didnt like about MK11 and removed the things I liked For instance Kameo fighters really ruin the aesthetics of MK IMO and fewer possibilities of customisation and fewer combos are also annoying,neg
1971870,This game is not a reboot of MK like it was advertised This is MK12 a direct continuation of the same story in MK11,neg

1971870,Still unable to play online with a proper network setup not a single match after 20 hours of game time no info on patches and solutions Holdout on spending the large amounts of cash for this premium product Extremely poorly optimized on PC,neg
1971870,"Not worth 70

Unoptimized  30 fps in movies 60 fps in fights  So the Fatal Blow moves are in 30 fps  They look horrible jumping out of a fight doing 60 in a cut scene doing 30  Story in itself is great until the end of it  It will make you groan since it feels like a cop out  

Combos have to be jammed in fast for the most part  Yes some areas it requires some timing here and there to allow your kameo to come in and extend your combos out or wait for the timing in a juggle but for the most part you gotta be fast  If you are not a fast button masher you may have problems with this one Beware older gamers too You might of gotten too slow over the years thats my problem  The kameo system is ok like a tag team system but IMO should be removed from the ranked side Some kameos are a lot better than others and you will see most players using the same ones

70 is way over priced  Content feels lacking to me  Feels like a money grab and will be expensive or a huge investment if you buy it now  If you did not preorder OOF  70 for base game  8 for Shang Tsung 8 for Havik can unlock character by completing the story 40 for the the 6 upcoming characters5 kameos  I am not sure when they are coming out so who knows when  If you want to be competitive 118 right now  Still 118 if you do premium gotta add Shang Tsung too Only difference is you get Van Damme skin and a bunch of krystals The rest of the DLCs are just cosmetic stuff

I still enjoy the game but you better served with the previous mortal kombats
The combat is more or less ok in what you would expect but sometimes feels unresponsive 

some things ive notice

 no longer you have awesome intros before fighting
 first thing Ive notice for some reason they seemed obssessed with accessibility options
 the crypt you can no longer pick an unknown unlockable actually theres no crypt is just a an animation I didnt really like the previous crypt but it was still better than this one that doesnt exist 
 making johnny cage like the main character feels dumb as he is so superficial 
 the story is full of cliches but not good ones 
 having the xray with two characters doesnt add anything to the game
 Im also disapointed with the invited characters
 The cenarios seem generic and you can no longer use object from them to fight  the only cenario I recall is the Shang Tsung lab the other MKs I can still remember the cenarios
 The new characters also feel a bit dull and generic
 just 1000 coins  1 spin to spend after ending campaign to get extra stuff
 finish the boss on first attempt and nothing special about the ending like the previous ones just a regular fight
 the 1 typo on subtitles as everyone probably already knows
 credits movie was going out of screen xD

progression system  so they system isnt based on general xp but these tedious challenges it makes no sense dont know why they gutted payday 2 xp system it was really good imo

I do want the game to be good as stealth heists in Payday 2 were fun but at the moment I cannot recommend the game and frankly with how Raid World War II went I wouldnt be surprised if the playerbase is dead after a couple of months At least there is crossplay with consoles to help with that but who wants to play with console players anyway",neg

If Lost Ark was changed to a system that removed systems that were considered pay to win such as gear honing card sets and engravings and none of its content changed it would be an unparalleled success in the Action RPG space even if launched today The classes and how they are designed to allow for skill expression and mastery  large variety of Interesting and unique dungeons memorable boss fights and story moments They have normal mode encounters that can rival even the most interesting pinnacle bosses content in Path of Exile or in Diablo 3 or 4 If Lost Ark released as a buy to play package and that package removed or massively overhauled Honing and the card system was a system that gave you all the sets just for playing through the game it would be a 1010

However since this is not a pure ARPG but an ARPG MMO there are systems in place that will prevent the normal gamer from reaching let alone completing this content in a reasonable amount of time as the game must limit your progress to ensure you cannot reach end game without encountering a few design decisions created to remove resources from the player economy and slow down progression

The Jump Server program is the first time this game will come close to be Free to play friendly in a while as the items that are given could get you to a place where a new player can start and within a few days  be able to attempt the end game raids and other pinnacle content 

Do not play this game if you are vulnerable to predatory monetization practices as power is sold in the cash shop RNG mechanics like The Card System and honing mechanics turn this game from a fun sandbox adventure to a casino As it is not uncommon to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this game in some regions Do not play this game the idea of having progress limited by Dailies and weekly caps is something that upsets you

I think if youre just slightly interested into MMOs or you took a look at the combat and it piqued your interest Give it a try theres currently a jump start server going on right now that lets you jump to the end game and play all the cool raids without having to do all the tedious questing If you complete two or three legions raids and find that its just not for you then unfortunately this game has nothing else for you But to those who enjoy raiding and exciting combat I highly recommend this game

Like I said this game can be very overwhelming at first If you arent the kind of person who doesnt want to spend extra time outside of the game figuring out ways to optimize your game play watching raid guides watching class guides then all I can really say is to just try the legion raids before you take your leave",pos

1627720,I just got all the achievements for this game and 5 playthroughs  completed This game was such a great time Basically harder Sekiro but with the artistic tone of Bloodborne which I personally loved  It was incredibly hard which I think should be toned down a tad by making the parry window a few frames longer but once you get used to it its just like Sekiro where you get into the groove of memorizing and dancing with the boss fights All the bosses are pretty amazing at getting you into that flow state minus a little overuse of delayed attacks on most enemies I highly recommend this for souls veterans People new to these style of game are going to have a steep learning curve though so I would be wary until they tone down the perfection required to complete the game I had no issues with the difficulty but I imagine others are going to have quite a problem with it Which in this case I do agree the parry and dodge could use some tweaking to be made more enjoyable as a player and less perfection required to to accomplish Overall I would give it a 810 and I think its a 910 for souls veterans,pos

An incredible game from start to finish Ive been itching a Bloodborne remake andor remaster and this is as close as Ill get for the time being 

Great combat story music visuals etc The only real thing of note that I did not like was the lack of poise  hyperarmor It really made it difficult to run heavier weapons because any little attack cancels your attack animation It got pretty frustrating at times so I had to change my weapon to something lighter",pos

1627720,I think its a great game Although I am not a fan of so many two phased fights and delayed attacks for which you have to remember the timing I enjoyed the the game a lot and I will do a second playthrough,pos
1627720,"There is so much good in this game being held back by a few key issues that I feel need to be addressed 
1 There is no poise mechanic Any damage whatsoever will break your attack or Fable Art
2 Enemy tracking is so intense that the dodge becomes the worst dodge in any Soulslike I have ever seen
3 Fury attacks demand that you parry but the parry window is incredibly tiny
4 Enemy attack windows are very erratic making parrying even more difficult

All of these could be forgiven except for the last issue
5 Bosses regenerate health until you stagger them

The boss regen really goes against the overall design since it incentives aggression but your windows of opportunity are so small and there is no animation cancelling You WILL overcommit a lot without trying

Lies of P could become the best Souls game not made by FromSoft if they can resolve some of these issues So unless you are really really invested in Souls games maybe wait for some patches when I can hopefully erase this review",pos

1627720,Someone somewhere is proud of this,neg
1627720,"Art good
Music great
Story fine
Gameplay frustrating

Bloodborne and Sekiro this aint Its trying to do this its own thing but its fallen into the post Elden Ring trend of haha got you enemy design It starts fairly strong but really starts to drag about 75 of the way in and I just wanted it to be over

Its not one singular point that pushes me into not recommending it but a whole bunch of small things that add up to an overall frustrating experience I didnt even do what I assume is the final boss because I was given a choice to end the game early because I was just done with this game wasting my time

There were a few that I did like though My 2 favorite bosses were Victor and Laxasia because they felt like classic well composed fair but challenging souls style bosses

Now for the list of frustrations
Specters While I found specters to mostly be a hindrance they are not remotely helpful for the players that needwant them unless you spec into it and you cant even do that until almost halfway into the game You also have to give up good abilities in the tree to get those specter abilities which means players that needwant to use them have to be overall weaker for 95 of the game
Camera can get really wonky on large bosses this is nothing new in soulslike games and continues to be a pain point
Animation locking can be really bad depending on the weapon
Basic mook enemies can be hitstunned to death with no brain activity
Too much reliance on corner ambushes very predictable
Anything that isnt a basic mook bigger enemies minibosses bosses almost all fall into haha got you post Elden Ring design

Lets talk about what I mean by haha got you design
Im quite tired and fatigued at this point with the following trends in difficult enemies
1 Winds up for like 3 seconds possibly with feints or weird movements to throw you off and then the attack comes out in 10 frames or less
2 Extend their combos once youve identified a gap in them and try to take advantage of it
3 Able to just nonstop combo rush you down with their base moveset
4 Combo chains that contain mixupsrng
5 Same windupmove but different timing
6 Infinite poise the stalker fights were quite a relief and actually felt pretty ok
7 Punishing you for landing a stagger by releasing an explosion or desperation attack before you can cash in the visceral
8 Every other boss being a 2phase fight

I just got pissed off and tired of this game Sekiro busted my balls but I never got pissed off at it because yes the enemies were fast challenging and agile but you could also react to them and they felt consistent I do like rhythm games so maybe thats why I enjoyed Sekiro more too

I hope the devs learned a thing or two from this one and the next one based on the end credit teaser will be better But as it stands now my time is too valuable and theres too many other good games out there to play that dont frustrate or piss me off to recommend this one",neg
1627720,"This is a heavy hearted no

The game is amazing I love the combat system the level design the enemy variety the setting

Until you hit a boss Then it gets sloggy and tedious it feels like nothing really transfers between boss fights Each is an exercise in wrote learning and takes longer than is fun

A bit if tuning and I would put this game in top 30 for me but alas theyve made the fatal sin of fromsoftware emulators and made it feel difficult in a tedious rather then satisfying way A shame as its the closest to capturing the magic and the innovation on the combat and weapon mechanics is great",neg
1627720,o,neg
1627720,its good until bosses otherwise fun unique weapons some need adjusting weapons feel weak and throwing objects are too strong,neg
1627720,"60 and no PS controller support 
Further more poor controls explanation Jump by pressing LS sure just failed to mention the conditions that need to be met for that to work So its LS Left stick to move  holding dodge to make you run  pressing LS which is strange as why do i need to sprint to jump 

Perfect Perry is much harder than in Sekiro and less consistent In Sekiro there are rules and consistencies here its a simple rule only try to parry if you want to die 

Special abilities are never explained simply says Use weapon art ok wtf does it do I have 2 of them both look the same when I do them What is the condition for them to be triggered These elementary things shouldnt be thought from continuously dieing and smashing buttons to test out the waters of how it even works That is reserved for mastering them not for learning how to walk",neg
1627720,Breeze past rather simple enemies struggle fairly against mini boss level enemies admire the world design in spite of jank barriers and throw yourself at bosses until you memorize all of their attacks and the weird timings Red attacks that must be perfect guarded the wind up for your own guard the tight window to perfect guard and the extreme tracking make this hard to recommend,neg
1627720,"A test of patience not worth taking Over halfway through the game and just barely tolerating this shit 0 redeeming qualities Every system and mechanic sucks No build variety total weaponlockdown via upgrade system You can respec halfway through the game but it doesnt even give the base points back so if you chose wrong in the beginning youre screwed forever

And it crashes every 60 minutes on the minute exactly",neg
1627720,It kind saddens me that I progressively lost interest as the game went on The parrying became more demanding as the bosses got harder and this is coming from someone who does not enjoy parrying that much The dodge button is effective but youre less inclined to use it when you know building up someones posture which will lead to more damage There is a good incentive to parry but when it becomes the only way to play the game it starts to get boring and redundant The areas were not that fun to explore and the balance towards the endgame just loses itself For this studios first souls like game its not bad but I think FromSoftware is still on top when it come to this genre,neg
1627720,Crashes everywhere,neg
1627720,"I want to summarise this review first and I might change it later

bSummaryb I think the game is OK but has a lot of major and minor design issues I think unless you love standing still and learning the block timings for every attack you will not find this game as fun as other Soulslike games

h3Minor issuesh3
 General animation jank and core combat isnt super smooth compared to other modern Souls offerings
 Lots of convenience features that should be in the game but arent
 Lots of confusing mechanics or oddities that are poorly explained eg leveling
 Weapon animations are very lack lustre


h3Moderate issuesh3
 Enemies reading your controller inputs to do frame perfect dodges Some even do Dark Souls style parryripostes on you from controller reads
 Seemingly no super armor at all even if you dump all your Fable into 1 attack This isnt in and of itself a huge issue because the game can be designed around it But this game isnt
 Because dodging is completely useless which is something I will address in major issues the choice of equipment heaviness is meaningless You might as well just pile on the equipment because dodging is practically worthless
 Also  weight of items just seems to solely go up Ive encounter no pretty good for a light armor options and all my amulets Elden Ring Trinkets just get more and more weight as they get more useful This means youre really forced to level capacity and just choose the heaviest equipment No creativity
 Net effect of the above two is that so far about 14 hours in there are no real equipment building options other than which weapons you use
 The stages are jokes barring a mini boss or two in the dungeons Its only the Bosses that are any challenge Unlike other Souls games the stages themselves are basically 0 threat The monsters are basically complete fodder

h1Major issuesh1
h21 Block is the only viable Defence so there are no meaningful choicesh2

Sekiro Wo Long and other Souls games all have the choice of blocking parrying dodging or just running out of the way Each works well for different attacks and is a valid choice for particular reasons

But in Lies of P the only thing that matters is Perfect Block Positioning and movement have almost no effect on boss fights other than not getting stuck on a wall So it never feels particularly fun to fight bosses

You literally just stand still watch their weapon and perfect block spam In 90 of circumstances dodging is strictly worse not a valid option with different advantages and disadvantages just worse So you stand still and block thats the gameplay

In Souls you fight a boss and you die to hits overhead attack You recognise the telegraph and you either block parry dodge or run out of the way If you fail you get 1 hit mostly If you die you know why

You eventually figure out what strat works for that attack and for all the other attacks And then you beat the boss and you feel great

But in Lies of P There is only ONE answer to how to deal with the fight block
Run 1 Perfect block 80 of the attacks not enough you run out of pots and die
2 81 of the attacks not enough
3 82

10 Finally pblock 90 which is enough to beat the fight

It doesnt feel like understanding the fight and defeating it When you die it doesnt feel like youve done anything fatally wrong Each attempt feels like you doing the same thing Then you just win There is no creativity of figuring out the strat just block better bozo

h22 Having to repair your weapon mid fight is literally the worst mechanic anyone has ever added to a souls gameh2 

I dont know why they thought this was a good idea Babies know better than to design games with mechanics like this There is nothing extra I need to say about this It doesnt add meaningful choices like in Monster Hunter It doesnt fit the gameplay It is just TERRIBLE and UNFUN

h23 To confirm a bossess stagger and you need to do a SLOW heavy charge attack and land ith2

When you perfect block you are rewarded with no damage taken but also a large amount of damage caused to the enemys stagger bar hidden which sucks  dumb design choice similar to SekiroWo Long However to confirm the stagger you need to do a SLOW heavy charge attack and land it

If the boss jumps back or youre just not in a decent position then you will miss the timing to confirm the stagger and you will lose all the reward of being a badass perfectblocker If the boss starts an attack since we have no super armor see moderate issues even on our Fable attacks youll just get interrupted 

From a game design point of view perfect block  eventually stagger  execution attack is crazy fun as demonstrated in SekiroWo Long and its a great way of rewarding the player for good play One of my favourite mechanics of all time

But Lies of P basically spits in your face w a randomiser If the boss jumps away does a combo or is just generally fast Good luck landing the charge attack You can make all the best choices as a player and still get screwed 

h24 The game wants to be as close to Soulsborne as the main series games as possible TO A FAULT But the few changes it does make are all negative changes that make the Soulsborne formula less funh2

There are SO MANY things in this game that feel like Wow this is literally just Dark Souls or Wow they literally just took this from Bloodborne But unlike other Soulsborne games which try to make significant fundamental changes to the formula Lies of P tries to play it straight keyword TRIES

Lies of P will have the NPCs speaking in cryptic and mystical ways and they have items with lore descriptions in them Just like Dark Souls BUT it also has NPCs narrating at you for minutes at a time characters that wont stop lore dropping you in the middle of a fight to explain stuff and also about 50 of the treasures youll find on the ground are journals for you to read to learn about the lore rather than useful items If wouldnt be a big deal if the game was clearly aiming at a storystrong Soulslike like say Code Vein or Nioh which have a lot of cutscenes but theyre clearly trying to do a Soulslore thing and so it just doesnt work

The writing overall is also poor and the English dialogue while not machine translation level is very odd at times and clearly not intentional From Soft did god tier level work to get the English dialogue to be as good as it is and this team just doesnt have it yet Its genuinely a pain to listen to half the characters and it feels like an amateur trying to replicate Souls style dialogue and failing at it Other Soulslike didnt have this problem because they did their own thing and werent trying to be the closest thing to Dark Souls

There are also more minor things like They want you to level up at the Maiden character Just like Dark Souls except they fucked it up by having you level up at Bonfires initially then they change it after the first boss fight without much explanation I went all the way through the next boss questioning why the bonfire wasnt work

They also literally put the Physick flask in the game except it sucks ass It takes forever to activate only gives you one minor effect And it doesnt regen with rests you have to go find a specific character off in the middle of nowhere to get your flask charge back Its completely useless

They even do the Quest NPCs you can talk to through the windows thing that Bloodborne does except its very hamhanded and token It feels like a cheap way to not need to make an NPC model rather than something that adds a lot of interesting lore and surviving life to the dying city

There is more to complain about but I literally cant fit in this post",neg
1627720,"I wish I WISH I could review this game as good but sadly I cant Ive beaten several souls like games Demon Souls all three Dark Souls Bloodborne Elden Ring Steel Rising Code Vein come to mind and in neither of those games have I come across this kind of bad game design I love souls games but I cant say I love this one Lets get into it
PROS
1 Amazing atmosphere  the devs nailed the Victorian setting of the game The city of Krat is dark and eerie and I enjoy exploring its dark streets
2 No need to look up info on the internet when trying to finish a side quest you will get pointers on where to go
CONS
1 Terrible enemy balance  there are 4 types of enemies in the game Boss Miniboss Miniminiboss and regular enemy The ones I call miniminiboss are almost everywhere especially once you get half way through the game they have a ton of HP and take a long time to beat making you use up your healing items only for another miniminiboss to be just around the corner
2 Hard to read attack patterns  listen Im  all for git gud but the attack patterns of enemies are very VERY hard to get a read on and most of the time you will still get hit regardless if you block parry or dodge the attack Plus they are ultra locked on you and no matter which way you go they follow you with their attack regardless if youre jumping away to avoid it
3 Unlockable dodging skills  cmoon its dodging that should just be a part of a souls like it shouldnt be something you have to unlock

Now if youre feeling particularly sadistic get this game you might enjoy it maybe youre one of those ultra hard core souls fans that inhales VaatiVidya videos of the lore of Fromsoft games but if youre more of a casual fan skip this one you probably wont have that much fin playing this",neg
1627720,"To the developer who made the lets walk on narrow beams around ranged enemies section of this game

I know you probably will never read this nor will it matter to you but I strongly suggest you consider a different career Perhaps youd be better suited to be a professional Dominatrix or maybe youd find more joy in life as a Baby Seal Clubber a Dog Catcher or perhaps a truly sadistic career like being a TSA inspector or a student loan debt collector I do not see how creating levels intended to frustrate people to the point of tears could bring you pleasure or joy as you are not present to see them

I do to some degree blame other gamers for encouraging a person like you to become a game developer  the entire get gud mindset clearly the work of masochists must have been a very strong attractant Consider though you hear our suffering only indirectly through negative reviews and perhaps messages like this one It lacks the visceral enjoyment youd get from experiencing our rage and dispair firsthand

Please quit",neg
1627720,i really wish there was a way to say mixed feelings because i like this game its fun but god are the bosses just terribly designed i love the level design it feels like a soul game but the bosses are so unfun to fight with telegraphing being extremely limited other than the big WATCH OUT RED ATTACK move most movesets in the game come down to the enemys charging up a large attack that is telegraphed and then randomly snapping the weapon down at you without alot of time to react it gets worse because of the guard penalty making it so if you miss one parry in a combo you will not be able to parry the rest because of the penalty you just cant pull your weapon up fast enough to parry ontop of that there isnt alot of incentive to parrying you dont get anything from it other than building up the enemys stagger meter maybe if they made it so when you do a perfect parry you get a little charge on your healing just so there is a incentive to playing risky like that and some of the weapons feel bad to use like the wrench does huge numbers but its range is so low you have to literally be hugging the enemy to do damage it just feels bad to use other weapons are fine mostly i do really hope that some things are changed in the future it just needs to be a little more polished,neg
1627720,"I am super dissapointed to say that after 12 hours of gameplay my save file dissapeared not sure if this is an ingame issue or on steams end but either way what the fuck

1627720,Art design in this game is incredible I had a great time in between the bosses but bosses in this game are badly designed in way that the devs just want to torture the players Boss mechanics are ridiculos and seems like they are implemented without any good reason other than to punish players Ye ye git good Unfortunately im not a adhd zoomer,neg
1627720,"The  combat is just bad
Dodge roll is delayed and does not get your of of attack distance so it has to be used multiple times for one attack meaning you need to start early and cant attack between the enemies moves
Your own attack range is impossible to gaige I just keep hitting air while every enemy has more range than yourself which means you are always on the back foot and need to be extremely carful
If your weapon colledes with a wall by a pixel you hit it and stagger meanwhile enemies face away from you hit into the wall and damage you standing behind them

The health bar is missleading so many times I think I killed an enemy but they are still alive and take a swing

Enemy attack patterns seem random so there is no telling what move set is going to happen to exploit it
Every desicion in combat needs to be perfect in a split second

The promt to use a heavy attack to stagger enemies is simply a lie the dont and hit you

Animation lock is real and enemies will just pound you instead of staggering themselves even the trash mobs
Because you yourself are stuck in your own animation you cant do anything but the game still registers some actions you did during animation lock queuing them to happen next so you are stuck in moves you cant break out of

At the start you can enter the wagon where you select your weapon but you cant change it meaning you make a decision and are stuck with it right away

Ranged enemies wont attack while you dodge so if you are close up you are forced to just take the hit because as long as you try to avoid it preemptively the enemy simply waits

It just plain sucks to be in combat",neg

Now for the drawbacks The expansions can be hit or miss each of them consisting of four seasons each year The story is delivered weekly in a drip feed that may be acceptable depending on what the season activities are

And then there are the technical issues That tenyearold engine Its showing cracks Any modification be they patches or just weekly resets is a roll of the dice Bizarre glitches connection issues etc 

Lastly theres the cheating Bungie has launched a heroic effort to combat cheating here Even going so far as to launch and win milliondollar legal battles with software makers of the top cheat aids Theres a builtin anticheat failsafe and though Im sure it catches its share of knuckleheads the cheating in PvP and PvE less a concern to me is out of control

Theres a lot to love about Destiny 2 you just have to be willing to put up with a lot of annoyance here and there

1085660,I have played Destiny since its original launch Love the game customization excellent PVE However after so many years so much money Bungle has made they STILL fail to fix server issues and spend those BILLIONS theyve milked outta players to fix an issue even after its gone on for weeks if you dont already play its HUNDREDS to unlock everything up to current content Dont waste the money or time just get a game that has stable servers and actually puts the money you spend on it into the game Its far too late for most of us players but anyone debating on trying it please dont for your own sake Bungle doesnt care they just want to milk us all till the servers light on fire and call it a day Anyone got a can of gas btw,neg
1085660,Literally unplayable in the current state cannot connect to servers for more than 2 minutes at a time enough to find a fireteam and then be disconnected for one of a dozen inconsistent error codes,neg

1085660,game would be great if the servers werent so unstable im playing campaign and getting kicked from the servers before i can even complete one mission Ive started the same mission 5 times now and right before I get a completion it kicks me off Bad enough I had to buy the expansion a second time while holding the exotic you got for PREORDERING the expack,neg
1085660,The servers are trash,neg
1085660,I Do really wish i could recommend this game as it can be so much fun however due to the recent weekends of various glitchs and DDOS attacks its evident bungie needs to look at improved security for there servers to make this game playable for the people who have PAID money to get you to play all the seem to care about is getting people to pre order the next expansion the final shape regardless of the state of the current game,neg
1085660,With DDos attacks on the daily a lot of you wont have time to play this unless you have the time to waste and the patience I wouldnt even bother right now,neg
1085660,This game is the equivalent to taking a laxative and eating taco bell at the same time,neg
1085660,Spent 5 hours trying to play the intro new light only to keep getting disconnected and forced to watch spoiler cut scenes when the game reconnects Steam wont refund so now I have a game I cant play because of crap servers but at least I know the plot spoilers Screw you Bungie,neg
1085660,No stop Just dont,neg
1085660,UNABLE TO CAN PLAY THE GAME,neg
1085660,fuck this game,neg
1085660,game bad used to be good now game bad game removed 90 of game from game game said fuck you to players players D game bad,neg
1085660,Not worth it Initially it was a fantastic game but Bungie has vaulted past content players have purchased making it so you cant access the content you paid for The new content is subpar if you can even get into the game as the servers are constantly a nightmare giving players random error codes The base Game was 99 buck for the collectors edition and each additional expansion is not free but another 99 bucks Save yourself the headache and time and find a better game,neg

1172470,"One of the best if not THE best BR game out there

Biggest issue is the skill based matchmaking which is total BS because all the top dogs use VPNs and will just stomp you

I dont often write reviews but I feel compelled to express my disappointment with Season 18

The matchmaking system is seriously flawed In many instances I find myself pitted against either lowlevel cheaters or seasoned predators which has seriously hampered the enjoyment for my friends and me And this is on nonAsian servers I can only imagine what the experience would be like there

Regarding the ingame shop and events the offerings have been lackluster at best It seems that Respawn and EA are attempting to recoup losses from Seasons 16 and 17 but the current state of the game provides little incentive for financial investment This is coming from someone who has purchased over 1200 gold skins and 22 heirlooms If things continue this way I foresee a significant decline in the player base and its disappointing that the developers dont seem to acknowledge this

The gameplay itself has become so unbalanced that it encourages teaming which in my view undermines the competitive nature of the game Its evident that the studios focus has shifted away from the needs and experiences of average players Ive decided to step back from the game for now and will consider returning once improvements have been made

From a greatly disappointed player


Sep 21st 2023

Are you out of your freaking mind WTF WTF is this normal game mode Do not force your customers to play shift There is no loot And fix your freaking match making system If you knew the old map is shift thats why you changed it dramatically dont just put it back in a even worse form You want money I get it and you know the easiest way to get money for you Make players like your game Not Making them QUIT 

Previously you had the decency to allow players to choose what to play normal or some horseshift mode This time What is wrong with you Respawn STOP FEEDING US SHIFT  Have you learnt nothing since the last time this game has died 

WHO is in you management team  WHO are your PROJECT MANAGERS 
FIRE THEM
They Clearly do NOT know SHIFT ",neg

1172470,"Other than almost winning a match and getting kicked for game error while also receiving a 10 minute penalty from the game auto abandoningdue to game error its an alright game

1172470,game is shit,neg
1172470,Unplayable via Steam corrupts your save on load and makes the damn thing unlaunchable via any method Not that im missing out on much adding so much garbage like making voice lines gender neutral Stay away from this sweatfest and show Respawn that Titanfall 3 was what everyone wanted not this horrible woke garbage game,neg
1172470,"I love this game solo q is rough if youre trying to rank up but the movement of Respawns games have always been amazing 

I cannot recommend this game to new players Even with the addition of the intro lobbies that are supposed to be new user friendly ie filled with bots as soon as youre out of it you will get stomped by high ranking preds and master ranked players regardless of the game mode The learning curve is steep and the community makes it steeper Smurfing is rampant and always will be and even if it werent an issue matchmaking will always put you in lobbies with someone whos macros and soft aim bot make them impossible to hit while theyre zeroed in on your forehead or predator ranked players 

If youre playing with friends it gets worse because matchmaking also prioritizes putting you with other 3 stacks who are all usually Master or higher",neg

1172470,Respawns gunplay and movement are simply unmatched No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound feel and look as good as the guns in Apex It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex Its truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer However heres a big and stinky but EA These two letters when put next to each other strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers The game is currently riddled with bugs hackers a scamdominated meta stale game modes pisspoor matchmaking and more What does EA make respawn focus on instead Pumping out more skins and collection events This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard with recolored skins littering the shop and events Meanwhile Mobile has 3 more legends than us a highly  and I mean HIGHLY  requested team deathmatch mode and tons of other cool features that the consolePC versions can only have wet dreams about Thank you EA You truly have the reverse Midas touch where everything you touch turns into piles of doodoo,neg
1172470,Apex Legends is a disappointing game that fails to live up to the hype The graphics are bland and uninspired the controls are clunky and unresponsive and the gameplay is repetitive and boring The selection of weapons and characters is limited and the matchmaking system is unreliable frequently matching players with people who are much higher or lower level than they are The ingame microtransactions are also a major problem as players are constantly bombarded with ads for new skins weapons and other cosmetic items Overall I wouldnt recommend Apex Legends to anyone looking for a fun and engaging multiplayer experience,neg
1172470,they never fix the game,neg
1172470,Respawn is not the same company that made Titanfall 2 anymore This is published by EA so you know theres no real progression unless you spend ungodly amounts of money for skins that dont look good You would think for a game with such good movement EA would realize how good this game could be Unfortunately the pros in this game arent good enough to move to another game and any new players immediately leave because this game also lags like crazy There is literally no reason to play this game I have played it since launch and its not like its gotten a 20 or health update to the game Im begging you please just dont play this game But if you do add me I guess,neg
