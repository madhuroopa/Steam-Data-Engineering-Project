Are you a forever DM? Tired of always having you campaigns hastily being put together. Want to be a murder hobo and regret nothing and be surrounded by only animals and your inner demons. well here is your chance to be the player you always wanted to be and experience the most well thought out story. even in early access I replayed the area with 4 different classes/races and got totally different experiences when even making similar choices.,True
"AAA Developers are ashamed of this game because it's a passion project by some of the most dedicated devs in the industry. This game takes a massive crap of excellence all over their attempts to entertain us with lifeless, mediocre husks. Games that provide such a plethora of meaningful decisions, world building, amazing combat, character progression, story telling, and dense exploration come by rarely anymore. Such an ambitious endeavor that deserves the attention it's getting. RPGs don't need to be just like Baldur's Gate III, but there's something for everyone to learn from Baldur's Gate III.",True
No preloading for a 122GB game. Feels bad to live rural and have slow internet. So much for playing on release day.,False
"I made the unfortunate decision of purchasing this game in early access, I spent hour attempting to enjoy it but could never really find much fun. The worst part however is I purchased this game before any of the awful things that I am sure people are aware of were added, knowing how despicable the developers are I would be willing to pay $60 to steam or another company for a refund just to keep my money out of Larian's hands. Even if you enjoy D&D I would recommend looking elsewhere for a game. This whole situation has taught me never to get games in early access. I would recommend that people spend their money somewhere else.",False

"TLDR:
   Would I buy it again? Not as of now.. If I could refund I would. Although, this might change as the game develops. That said, It's a bit too unstable, the UI is too cluttered, and the game is a bit too woke for me. Which, ruins the immersion I'm looking for in my RPG's. Also, this is firmly a more adult game imho.


review still in progress. Would wait to buy if I were you. It ain't no DOS2 experience. Even though, its massive, and heavily developed in comparison.",False
"This game is very frustrating and escalates very quickly. Lots of people glitching out, dialogue glitches. Im trying my hardest to enjoy this but am having a hard time. As a socially anxious person I chose to have high charisma, but I still seem to fail everything and start fights with random npcs or quests. Looking forward to hardness settings as promised.",False
"Played 3 hours of early access. Doesn't seem like this would be a fun game for me, not sure why i deceded to purchase this..oh yeah. Peer pressure.",False

"Hello,
I wanted to share my thoughts on Baldurs gate 3, that I purchased in early access. Initially, I refrained from playing it, as I preferred to experience the full release without spoiling the excitement. I eagerly awaited the release. However, as the release date approached, I couldn't resist the temptation and decided to create my character in advance.
To my surprise, one of the first options I encountered was ""Non Binary gender."" I found myself questioning the necessity of bringing political correctness into gaming. Couldn't we simply enjoy games without involving LGBT-related elements? It left me feeling disappointed, and I couldn't help but wonder why games can't just be about fun rather than being politically correct. Also, it is not like the game is not flexible or already open in that regard.
The Witcher and Lord of the Rings series were spoiled because of political correctness. Now, unfortunately, the Baldur's Gate series has also suffered the same fate.

I regret to say that I will not be purchasing any games from your company again.",False
"It plopped me in and didn't tell me how to control my character at all. I then presumed it'd be point and click when WASD moved the camera. But I couldn't figure out how to rotate the camera, and overall it was just nauseating.",False
"Well, I should've known better.

This is a 5E product, and as such it is burdened by all the horrible developments that constitute WotC's rule over the D&D IP.

The once interesting Forgotten Realms, which featured distinct cultures and civilizations has been turned into a mishmash that would best be described as ""2023 Seattle"". Hoping for any difference between a Cormyrean and a Calishite? Better luck next time.

Hoping to see any definite morality in a game that has literal gods that create races to follow and worship them? Better luck next time. What once used to be something really special and weird (Drizz't comes to mind) is now just common and mundane. The first character you meet is in fact a Githyanki, part of a race of Astral plane slavers and sadistic conquerors. She's kind of a good person in the game. 

Tieflings, which used to be Chaotic Neutral (with evil tendencies) are presented as good-hearted refugees that you're supposed to side with in a conflict with Druids of Silvanus. You can have a party member that is an escaped Vampire Thrall, another who is a Warlock (another WotC abomination).

But all of these people don't have any defining trait. All WotC monster races are just humans in funny suits. Humanity used to be the varied race. By definition, humanity was the adaptable race, the ones who would turn with the vagaries of time and experience. But WotC has turned all the singular and interesting races into humans with purple skin and horns, infinitely reducing what used to make these races different and interesting. When everyone is special, nobody is.

But why am I talking so much about behavior and alignments? There's no such thing in this game. You have a priest of Shar (a VERY evil deity) in your party, but she doesn't seem to be particularly evil. The vampire spawn dude is the perfect stereotype of the gay evil elf, the warlock (who, remember, has a pact with some sort of fiendish creature that gives him power) is supposed to be a good guy who's nice to kids (tiefling kids at least). Nothing makes sense in this new hodgepodge of morality that is modern D&D. 

In fact, the only character that kind of makes sense is the human mage that appears to be good-hearted and follows Mystra. He could have passed for a War Wizard of Cormyr in pre-WotC D&D.

To all the people that think that applying modern human (i.e. gray) morality is better because it reflects reality, think again. This isn't reality, this is a fantasy world. Moreover, it's a fantasy world where morality is not something created by humans, not merely a concept, but something as real as gravity. In fact, probably more real, since gravity can be manipulated by magic.

In a world where gods are real, and have innate moralities, and the races were created by these gods, morality is something absolute, not relative. If you keep committing evil acts, you end up going to the Abyss or Gehenna, or Carceri as a petitioner after you die. You ARE what you do and believe. But WotC would have you believe that morality is fluid for everyone, and doing things that are wildly out of character is ok. So they just decided to take alignment right out of this game. Now priests of Shar can be good guys! Githyanki don't need to be slavers! Tieflings don't have to be influenced by their demonic heritage! Woohoo, it's a free for all guys! What were once interesting deviations from the norm are now....just the norm.

As a result, humanity is now reduced to an uninspired blob, and demihuman races are now just humans in funny suits.

Now, all this is not a direct knock at Larian Studios, since they just follow WotC's directions here. It's the way modern D&D is, so BG3 will reflect modern D&D.

So, if you are in any way interested in old-school D&D, this is not a game for you. I imagine this will be a massive hit with the modern D&D crowd, since it follows pretty much every trend set by the TTRPG as it is in print today.

For someone like me, it's just so tiresome to see what D&D and TTRPGs in general have been reduced to. I'll just keep gaming with my old books and ignore whatever comes next, both in the print and digital worlds.

If I could, I'd refund this, but alas for the two-hour limit.

P.S.: This is an early access review, so maybe the finished game ""subverts all my expectations""....but I doubt it.

P.P.S.: I also forgot to mention the whole romance thing. This seems to have become a major part of modern D&D and CRPGs for some reason. I've always found it a distraction at best, a useless waste of development resources at worst. In the case of this game, there's even the added problem of the whole bestiality thing, with the gay elf/bear scene. Now that appears to have been a bug where the druid stayed shapechanged into the cutscene, but still.

P.P.P.S.: As another addendum, I would really love to be able to create a full party in order to avoid all this prefab character nonsense, but I'm pretty sure this won't really be an option in the full game. Apparently you'll be able to customise the prefabs to some extent, but there won't be a full party creation system.",False
"This game as it stands currently suffers from a good handful of design issues, since it's in EA there are a lot of unfinished parts, even as early as the first few minutes of the game. QOL and performance suffers heavily, even for beefy systems. The pre-made characters are so incredibly uninteresting that I made 4 original characters, ran the game at the same time in an MP game just so I can get them into my own party. I also have played a ton of solo party play due to how lackluster and lame the pre-made characters are. It's incredible the amount of lore Larian can pull from only to make each pre-made the same character traits and backstories that I personally couldn't care less for. The game as it is now is so much like DOS2 that it could be considered a MOD IMO. 

Now I'll mention how horrible it is that because I bought the game in early access, thinking they'd hit their first initial release date in Oct 6th of 2020! I now have to unintall, wipe everything BG3 related off my system, wait for launch date (since pre-load doesn't work) and re-install a brand new product/game. I can see why they upgraded everything to the upgraded version who bought it early, to ease the pain lol.

Hopefully the final release fixes all these issues (some I doubt will). And I'm hoping I can update this review of this particular product to better reflect a good final release. But as it stands right now, and what I need to do for final release, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.",False
"Woke Overload: Baldur's Gate 3

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆

Where do I begin with Larian Studios' latest dive into the world of politically correct fantasy, otherwise known as Baldur's Gate 3? From the moment I loaded the game up, it felt like I was stuck in a Dungeons & Dragons themed 'Woke 101' class.

The character creation process has been converted into a woke-fest. In a seemingly desperate bid to include every single possible identity group, Larian has forgotten that the point of a character creator is to set up a character for an epic adventure, not make a political statement. Yes, diversity is great, but when my entire playthrough is dictated by an avalanche of ""woke"" choices, it becomes clear that the game's developers had their priorities mixed up.

It seems as if every line of dialogue in the game has been scrutinized through a 'woke' filter to ensure nobody could possibly be offended. We're dealing with a gritty, fantasy world here, not a Sunday school class. The 'woke-washing' of the dialogue just strips away the authenticity and immersion that the Baldur's Gate series was renowned for.

And don't even get me started on the portrayal of the Drow and Goblins. These are supposed to be dark, dangerous, morally ambiguous races, not poster children for a woke re-education campaign. It's as if Larian decided to hold sensitivity training for fantasy races and then serve us that as a 'revolutionary' feature.

The clear preoccupation with 'wokeness' has caused a hefty toll on the gameplay mechanics. Unbalanced classes and an oversimplified combat system prove that the developers were too busy 'woking up' the game instead of fine-tuning it. There are enough bugs in this game to start a virtual entomology lab, but that's okay, because Larian was too busy making sure their game could win a 'Woke Award' than ensuring it ran smoothly.

In conclusion, Baldur's Gate 3 has morphed into a 'woke' manifesto wearing a D&D costume. In their rush to champion progressive causes, Larian forgot about what really matters - the gameplay, the storytelling, and the raw, gritty charm that made the original games so beloved. If I wanted to attend a lecture on 'wokeness', I'd sign up for a social justice webinar, not play a fantasy RPG.",False
"Awful. Buggy, Glitchy, freezing mess of a game. This close to full release, it's sad.",False
"""Inventory Manager 3.0"" is what the game should be called. Many rooms have 30 or more lootable objects. Some rooms have a lot more. 

99.9% of your loot is worthless, random trash. My characters at this point have about 3.4 billion items, nearly all of which are entirely worthless. In a recent fight, I was looking whether any of my character have a bottle of water (to throw onto a fire). It took 8 minutes out of game to carefully go through all the stuff I had, and I'm only level 4. 

Of course, among the worthless trash hides the sort of D&D loot you play the game for: a scroll, a greataxe +1, etc. Which means you actually have to do inventory management and cannot simply ignore or sell all. 

So here is how I spent my time so far. 

1) To make sure to find these valuable items, you spent 60% of the time in this game looting objects. Some rooms actually, literally take 10 minutes to loot because there are more than 100 interactable items. If you have a stealth character that can steal, this gets much, much worse. 
2) 20% of the time is then inventory management, because your characters are overloaded all the time. So you move things around between characters, or into your stash. Very enjoyable roleplaying experience. 
3) The remaining 20% of the game are then used for trying to sell these objects you spent so much time to acquire. Note that this is time consuming because 1) you want to sell 99% but not the one or two important quest or worthwhile—so you need to be careful what you sell. Also, it is time consuming because 2) no single vendor in the game has enough money to buy all your useless crap.

Of course, if you don't want to play loot manager 3.0, you can just ignore all loot. In which case you won't be able to beat the game—and in which case you probably don't pay 60 bucks for a D&D game. 

PLEASE remove most items from the game. Or give us a bottom to only loot items worth more than a gold coin. Or give us a button to sell all trash. Or fix it in any other way all other games since 2005 have fixed this.

"I have massively high hopes for this game. The potential is off the charts, and I could see it ending up as one of my favorite games of all time. It's not that right now, and for a simple reason. Combat Balancing.

Having played a decent amount of tabletop RPG's in my time, I feel confident in saying Baldur's Gate is incredibly similar to a campaign ran by a DM that gives a lot of effort, but has little experience. 

I'm only 12hours in, and It could just be an early access thing, I hope it is, but combat (a lot of the game) is genuinely not enjoyable due to the encounters. Every single one goes one of two ways. Either nobody gets touched, or i use every resource. Theres no in between. The gameplay loop, in its current iteration, is explore until you reach a hard encounter, pray you dont wipe, go to camp, go again. I play games to play games, Not to sit in loading screens. I can accept loading screens, its a part of a game, that doesnt mean they need to be 1/5 of the game time. 

For an example, ill give you the last few before I hung it up for now. First encounter was ~5 enemies, 3 of them start incapacitated, none have HP over 12. They have no abilities, they just melee. The encounter after that was ~5 enemies, all of them 20+ hp. The ranged enemy did enough damage with his basic to knock any of my party members. The 3 melees were capable of doing 3/4 of anyones health, enough to knock the backline. The game also forces you to fight uphill, so enjoy eating 1 shots with advantage from the ranged one.

If you do decide to buy it, for the love of god, save. They have the autosave set up to go in bunches, and its 1 time location based. Youll get 3 autosaves in a 5 minute period and then nothing for the next hour, so youll need to be making manual saves.

TLDR: Games great, could be fantastic, just needs a heavy heavy coat of polish to make it fun to play.",False
"Honestly just severely annoyed with the game and company at this point. I love larian don't get me wrong, great game, great stories. But BG3 has been a gaggle ****. Heres to hoping the game is EVERYTHING they say its going to be even though we ALL know it won't be. over 10,000 endings? Yeah okay......",False
