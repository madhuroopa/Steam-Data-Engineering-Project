"Joyous chaos! Most fun I've had gaming in a long time. Non-stop laugh out loud moments, generally upbeat and funny coms chats, danced in a circle to Polish accordion music. Lots of depth. All kinds of play-styles. I've only just scratched the surface. If you're curious enough to be reading this, just buy it already.",True

"Its amazing, just a great game all around.

This game is trash.,False
"Far too many insta-kill moments. It's a hardcore shooter, beware casuals.",False
Maps are so awful I can not recommend it at all. Progression is so slow it isnt worth it (I have a job). The only point ill give the dev is weapon models and accuracy to their real life counter parts. Other than that this game is extremely lack luster for the rather low price tag. Phantom forces is somehow better just because the maps play way better. If you want to scratch the battlefield itch just reinstall BF4. I seriously think the only reason this rather mediocre game gets any amount of praise is the fact that triple A titles do nothing but disappoint whenever people are met with a project that has at least some effort put into it they convince themselves that its good. This is not good and this game will not last like BF4 has.,False
I thought it was supposed to be better than battlefield but whenever i play it it does not give that same joy.,False
.,False
the game is a joke. Boooo!,False
"At first the devs would ban people for exploiting, it's been weeks of people using macros to lean left/right really quick so they get no recoil. It's getting worse and worse each day.  Not returning to the game till they actually ban people. When you see people with 20+ reports of exploiting and they killed you using the macro it just shows they don't care.",False
This Game Blows Ass. Talk about easy anticheat literally the easiest platform to cheat with which a large percent use even had sombody send me the link to a website www.bittlebattle.org/easymode,False
"no, the sniper and vector are broken and there seem to be no changes in balance for a game that has age and new sales.",False
I have never had an issue with easy anti cheat before. And initially this game would run great for me. But now I get packet losses every game and have yet to finish a whole game without losing connection and getting dropped. The game itself is wonderful but holy **** fix your connectivity.,False
Not what i expected. Roblox can do a better job of a game like this.,False
"Game is a balancing nightmare. High level players will have guns which kill you in 1 or 2 shots while you can unload half a clip into someone and they don't even flinch. Most guns and classes are completely worthless, while sticking you with a terrible weapon by default. Loadouts are complicated in a way that isn't fun to manage. I know call of duty has been locking better guns behind higher prestige levels for years and years but I'll never understand it. A multiplayer shooter should be about skill and reflexes, not time sink. I bought this game expecting an old school style shooter experience and this isn't it at all.",False
"If you like getting head shotted as soon as you spawn in. This game would be a great choice. Probably a lot of cheaters, who knows.

Spawn and die simulator 2023",False
"It happens with any game that gets this large, cheating. It is so bad as of recent, It feels like they arent being removed fast enough nor really even get detected, so youre stuck match after match being found in spots no normal person would look, shot through walls....Jump in a match and spectate, its wiiiillldddd how many you find.


Its a great game, but wouldnt plan on many sticking around unless its fixed asap.",False
Not sure I understand the hype. Not that fun. Clunky movement. If I could give it away I would.,False
cheating is a big problem,False
"Until the vector, p90, and mp5 aren't the only guns the player base use, I cannot in good faith recommend this to someone. You don't get any of the stupid 'meta' guns until at least rank 70. So until then you just get rolled by people exploiting the broken weapons in the game.",False
"No point in having both a mute button and a report mic spam button 

FIX YOUR GAME",False
"127v127 too much, 32v32 is playable but still the spawns are stupid, you've got 15 teammates around a building and you spawn on them and get killed from a dude behind you when your team is all around him? Spawns completely make the game unplayable, just makes you mad when you get a decent spot for sniping and then they're all behind you all of a sudden. Also the guns at later stages are 10x better, I get that you need something to keep playing for but the first sniper is complete trash compared to the last few. Snipers can't 1 shot unless in the head which is stupid. Yet I can have a dude with a vector 2 shot me from across the map doing the same dmg as a sniper? Needs to be more thought out to actually enjoy the experience. Make the spawns so that the game is based around their points so you know the enemies are in that general area not all around the map and randomly behind you having 10 dudes spawn on a camper to flank you, stupid. Keep spawns on points, add battle royale and Search And Destroy.",False
"The longer you play, the more you realize that severe flaws in the game will never get fixed. SMGs are way too good at mid range, no one will vote in games (something like 30 people vote total after a match), and there's zero reason to play any other class other than medic at the moment. I'll take a look after this game officially launches.",False
