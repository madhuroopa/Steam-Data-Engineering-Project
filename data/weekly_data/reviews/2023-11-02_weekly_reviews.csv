2399830,game is amazing i would buy it before it gets more expensive,pos
2399830,I had a minor orgasm after playing this,pos
2399830,This game is good unfortunately not as good as og Ark since Ive played that the longest Yet I give this game a 1010 Graphics are stunning all throughout the map,pos
2399830,"heheheheh dinosaurs 33

I LOVE this game Even on low settings the game is absolutely stunning and incredibly easy to sink an ungodly amount of time into in one session Probably the best addiction Ive had

Ive seen a lot of reviews talking about the game running poorly however strangely with my 3060 its been running beautifully smooth on at least medium settings Theres a few issues with crashing at the moment but it isnt excessive and its expected this early on",pos
2399830,"This game has everything dinosaurs crafting building exploration and PvP But the swamps the swamps are something else Theyre dark atmospheric and full of aggressive and deadly dinos

The game is still super fun to play especially with friends But be warned its buggy crashes a lot and is not optimized at all I have a topoftheline computer and I still have problems

Despite all of that I still recommend this game Its just insanely fun But be prepared for a bumpy ride",pos
2399830,it scoo be doo be cool,pos
2399830,great improvement from ASE but still needs work,pos
2399830,"If you liked ark SE youll like this game While this game had a very very rough couple few days 2030fps on NASA PCs WC worked hard and have made the game very much more playable on averageslightly older pcs Dont go into it expecting 165fps youll more than likely hit no more than 90 however with how beautiful the Island now is youll forget about it rather quickly

This game is a work in progress so keep that in mind before buying or playing but it is a great update to regular ark with many much needed quality of life changes",pos
2399830,This is the most amazingly amazing experience of pure amazement,pos
2399830,"After about 4 hours or so of tweaking the graphical settings i got her running mint 
Graphics are 1010
I love ARK so this is amazing to me Great game updates to come hang in there fellow survivors",pos
2399830,yes,pos
2399830,Loves it,pos
2399830,better looking dinos,pos
2399830,so far so good,pos
2399830,I enjoyed Ark Survival Evolved and now that they have upgraded it to Ascended it looks so realistic Love it,pos
2399830,My personal computer is too bad to run it with decent graphics Probably a game but I wouldnt know,pos
2399830,"I see a lot of people criticizing the games performance but it runs far better than ASE did when it first launched The game doesnt even run bad enough to make it unplayable if you have a decent pc I was averaging 20 FPS on medium settings so if you want to be a spoiled brat and call that unplayable go ahead The game also has had a few performance updates in the just over a week it has been released that have drastically improved the games performance I dont get why people review bomb a game when it first releases especially if it is early access It makes no sense now I understand the argument that a game should be finished upon release that being said it is still in early access with many more performance issues to be solved I understand that we all have waited anxiously since the announcement of the game for its release but to whine and cry that you cant play it in 4K 144FPS on day one is just asinine 

EDIT I also see a lot of people upset about Nitrado for the DRM implementation in addition to other problems that face the players of this game and I agree that it should be removed having to pay over 400 is ridiculous especially when we didnt have to do that for ASE",pos
2399830,Great UI and quality of life improvements from the previous game,pos
2399830,its  a solid game since the release they have fixed almost all the bugs that were in when it launched im liking it more then Ark Survival Evolved all in  all a great game,pos
2399830,Honestly  wait till they fix it I am crashing every ten minutes and if i am able to make any progress it gets wiped because the game crashed on the lowest graphic setting possible Right now the game is loaded with bugs It not worth spending 40 Rather play the original ARK,neg
2399830,"I have a 3080 and it runs like complete shit Ive tried a few of the fixes Anyone saying the game runs well enough if you change your settings is on copium This game runs like shit 
This level of optimization is embarrassing even for Ark If you have to change ini settings and change everything to lowmedium just to get 5060 FPS is it actually running well No",neg
2399830,"Given that I have a pretty solid PC and still cant play this game much past medium settings is pretty sad Its literally ASO all over again Same bugs same issues same piss poor optimization Random crashes from just closing the inventory As far as I last checked ASA isnt supposed to support local split screen But plug in your favorite controller and hit the pause button and youll be greeted by the menu AS WELL as a split screen character creation as well as a fatal leak crash

At medium and a couple low settings at 1440p and DLSS I was able to get 120140fps Low around 90 at sunrise
A quick test at high settings had me at 70fps and massive stuttering Crashed after I took two steps Pretty disheartening for a 1100USD GPU
 Sad to see that most games released this year rely so heavily on frame generation to achieve a playable frame rate 
Let it get some patches in before wasting your money unless you dont mind it looking slightly better regular ARK on epic settings",neg
2399830,30 FPS at medium settings on lastgen GPU and CPU,neg
2399830,They made a horrible decision with their servers not enough room on official for how many copies sold As well you figure as a remaster they would know how to deploy by now they are still working through fixing bugs that should rather be time spent on future dlcsmaps slackcard what can you say,neg

2399830,It aint ready yet,neg
2399830,40 for reskin is crazy plus you need a pc that can run alien technology to even run this game in medium quality if youre lucky you can get 10 fps might as well go play with google slideshow,neg
2399830,"Runs poorly and crashes often on an RTX 3070  Ryzen 5 5600X  32gb DDR4 Multiplayer is barely functional Although private hosting on your hardware is available server rental is now exclusively through Nitrado at 25month This game is not ready to be brought to market and the publishers greed is readily apparent

Game itself is beautiful and impressive when it works The optimization patches released over the last few days have made a big difference performance wise but under the hood is still an unstable mess Frequent CTD when interacting with menus inventory game menu as well as during extended playtime 1 hour Like its predecessor maybe itll be good in a few years Or maybe like Atlas theyll take the money and run",neg
2399830,Its ARK It may look better but nothing has changed its still shit an unoptimized Crash every 10 mins on official servers Garbage,neg
2399830,unplayable a waste of money The reason its early access is pretty obvious i was hoping it was different It is plagued with bugs and game crashes even for my system ASrock 790c motherboard 32 gigs ram RTX 4070 ti 13th gen intel i713700KF really disappointing that i receive critical failure crashes VERY often to the point i lose most of my dinos and bases due to dc I was hoping after so many years of issues with ARK SE that they would have figured things out but wildcard has done it again I would only recommend this if you want the experience of paying for a BETA Its early release is because there are so many bugs even if the game does look amazing With this type of game you cannot afford DC or crashes Wasted too much time for consistently wiping,neg

Fcking hate this game valve needs to fix this piece of sht game You cant even warm up anymore by playing deathmatch for a couple reasons 1 they removed tdm which was better to warm up in because you were dying less and having a better time 2 for some fcking reason valve thought it would be a good idea to not only have ffa and the only deathmatch game mode but make it to were it spawns you with half the fcking lobby already gunning you down before you even have chance to move Its impossible And they removed headshots only for my team tho other team has aimbot

730,Controls for the Steam Deck are completely broken to the point that I had to spend nearly half an hour configuring everything manually as even the community layouts werent working Combined with the fact that CS2 completely replaced CSGO with no warning the continued prevalence of loot boxes and the generally toxic player base that will kick you out of a casual match for not being able to keep up with mouse and keyboard players as you struggle with practically nonexistent gamepad support youd be better off spending your time somewhere else,neg

949230,Just turn the graphics settings down and its an actually addictive fun game like I genuinely cant stop playing it Someone help me,pos
949230,If you like Cities Skylines 1 then you will probably like Cities Skylines 2 In my short time playing so far the performance doesnt seems to be too bad I have an RTX 2080 and Intel 8700k with 32gb ram and my framerate has been playable and is comparable to cs1 with lots of asset mods I believe that the devs will be able to get the game into a better state with patches  down the road I think that if some of the models and textures were to be simplified a lot of the vram issues would be taken care of I was flying around at ground level and noticed that billboards are an insanely high resolution and I dont think its necessary I wouldnt doubt it if that was the cause for the high vram maybe they are svg vector graphics or something Anyway CS2 had a better launch than KSP2 so Im happy,pos
949230,"The games not perfect by any means and was released 6 months before it should have been but at the same time its nowhere near as bad as the drama llamas make it out to be Ya your framerates arent gonna be great Nov 2023 but at the same time its not a first person shooter it just doesnt matter that much and it plays well enough 

Many of the missing features at launch have been added in the last couple of patches and several more have been announcedpreviewed but not added yet If youre looking right now Id say maybe just wait but next spring the game will be good and you should buy it and have a good time with it by then

If youre from Paradox and reading this add Steam Community Workshop support you silly gits Nobody wants to go watch paradox attempt to reinvent the wheel by creating something thats worse than what already exists with Steam  Stop making dumb decisions or just go all in on stupidity and hire John Riccitiello CEO of Stupidity",pos
949230,"While it doesnt yet provide all of the depth of the previous game it lays out an exciting new foundation for a new and improved generation of city building

There are some performance problems for sure for me starting around when you get to 20000 people or so",pos
949230,"Performance issues are well known so Ill start there All in all I find it quite playable for me with a Ryzen 5800X and a Radeon 6700XT on Medium or even High though Medium is definitely smoother 4050Fps on average a 2560x1440 Unless I choose very low settings my GPU is always running 90 give or take about 5 whether in menus in an empty town

But onto the gameplay Its fun I miss some of the sound effects from the original but the music and general ambiance is very similar The radio has DJs talking periodically which gets very repetitive and annoying Id love to just turn that off entirely Turning off Ads didnt seem to do that Theres a skill tree system so things arent entirely just unlocked by leveling up which I like that it lets me prioritize what I want

Things seem a lot more indepth than the original but not overwhelming either Its a good balance and I really find playing and building my city is just as enjoyable overall in 2 I fear for future performance in larger cities since I havent let any grow too far yet

I have what seems like bugs with complaints about healthcare and noise being awful even on an incredibly small town with a clinic thats very lightly used and no obvious sources of substantial noise pollution near my residential zones This has persisted through the two updates thus far but I understand they have other priorities right now

I think this game has just as much potential if not more than the original and I look forward to where it goes Its a bumpy road still right now though But if you loved the original and think your PC can run it in a way thats tolerable for you I really do recommend it",pos
949230,Just awesome,pos
949230,Good game 1 week out needs some improvement  Many improvements over the 1st game  It just needs to be optimized Looking forward playing this more when more bugs are fixed,pos
949230,"Game is already starting to feel more stable after the second patch CS II has a surprising and impressive level of detail and nuance the cities really start to feel VERY alive once you get going Definitely a lot of fun even coming from the original 

A couple of things Ive learned 
  When you see rent is too high  you generally just need to up the density of the zones Seems obvious but it took me a minute to figure that out 
  Parking seems to be VERY important for CS II If you start zoning medium or high density residentialcommercial its very important to make sure to have some extra parking lots Cars will just drive around aimlessly for hours looking for parking if they cant find any
  Education is pretty important Make sure to build the elementary schools high schools and colleges as soon as they are unlocked Income will massively increase once citizens start to get educated especially at the college level 
  Garbage works a little bit differently in CS II The incinerators still seem to be a bit buggy but its not gameplaybreaking CO has acknowledged this apparently the next patch will fix it Just zone a landfill and expand the zone for now itll work fine
  Service range seems to be a lot better in CS II No need to plaster the map with crematoriums and incinerators anymore just one or two will usually do Massively improved over CS1 
  Make sure to check the air pollution map before zoning industrial Wind direction impacts where the pollution will go 
  The traffic AI is pretty advanced Cars use all available lanes traffic accidents happen in congested areas and cims even get lost sometimes Really neat to see the depth of the simulation although do note it takes a little bit of getting use to some of the strategies that worked for CS1 might be different for CS II Im still learning how to manage traffic its definitely different in CS II 
  You can still get the nice avenues with trees in CS2 but you need to go into the road tools and add them from there By default theyre built without the trees but its still possible to get them they look pretty nice once they have them Of course the downside is that you lose parking on the road by doing this so make sure you have extra parking lots in busier areas 

The game still has some bugs its not necessarily perfect at this point in time But I also definitely didnt feel like any of the issues were remotely gameplaybreaking after the second patch The game is a lot of fun and definitely feels like its going to be a great successor to the original especially once you get familiar with how CS II does things",pos
949230,"Had no issues so far only made a city up to 10K population though keep restarting after learning more about the game running it at 1440P ultra wide on a 3090 left all settings on high and get a smooth performance although only at 30fps 

The game does play quite different to CS1 lots to learn good fun so far",pos
949230,Yes there are performance issues however it is still quite a good game People have way to high of expectations for a game that just came out If you can tolerate around 30 fps on a medium level pc id highly recommend this game,pos
949230,"This is a very good sequel to the original Cities Skylines Even if its missing some features at launch such as the editors and a few minor details such as props I still highly recommend

I enjoy the new gameplay and progression system and the music is simply sublime City Skylines 2 is a good game overall even though a tad pretentious",pos
949230,If you like Cities Skylines 1 and can handle the performance requirements I recommend it,pos
949230,Good Game If you played Cities 1 it will feel familiar but yet its different,pos
949230,There are a lot of negative comments I havent personally found any major issues A new and improved experience from CS I Cant wait to see what is to come,pos
949230,the game so far is great have found a bug or two but if you watch the developers play the game they are taking notes on the bugs and are confident on the fixes,pos
949230,Like all Paradox games this one is good and will be great about a year after release  Missing features are ok for EA but not final release  Bugs are ok but not for final release  All that said I still like it a lot,pos
949230,"While the launch problems with the game at this point are well known and its absolutely silly that the texture settings appeared to have been reversed on launch and my game currently looks better on low textures than high I am still enjoying the game  I wish it had been delayed 1 month to sort much of this stuff out before launch but it appears the bones are strong the intended enhancements to management and progression are promising and I look forward to years more of playing the game once problems are corrected  

No free pass for a bad launch here but 2 patches less than 10 days in has improved the game a great deal If you are a fan of the genre I think you will like the game even in its current state and will love it down the road  Casual players should wait to buy for a while as the kinks are worked out",pos
949230,Day 1 optimization was rough After a week already seeing improvements Gameplay is great,pos
949230,Better than the previous one Started with more and besides performance its going in the right direction,pos
949230,"Was so excited for this game but it came out way to early and has some bugs that make it unplayable
1 Played a city for 9hrs and the save file was randomly deleted and I lost everything
2 had several crashes for seemingly no reason losing hours of work
3 the game is terribly optimized and lags like crazy whenever you try to do something even with medium or low settings
All of these issues are shared by people on the internet Im sure it will get better with time but for now I do not recommend buying it
The mechanics are great though and I did have fun but Im extremely displeased with the games functionality",neg
949230,I think all things considered that in some aspects it does have some improvements from the first However there is more detail building in the first with mods assets and already in game vegetation and pathways You can detail the first city skylines WAY better then this one I feel as if i cant build my city the way i truly want and it is disappointing Paradox please fix this with out having to have me pay for stuff that was included in the first,neg
949230,its uh rough,neg
949230,I was super excited for this game but at this point its just infuriating In my experience this game has way more issues than just performance issues The auto grid system has been abysmal the importing of power has been atrocious honestly at this point just stick with the first game give it a few months to a year before you buy,neg
949230,"I cant recommend the game in its current state I mean the fps issues are one thing but in my opinion its not even visually appealing for the amount it is taxing I build a road through a mountain and mountain doesnt even make a proper hole It has the mountain clipping off half the entry hole Textures randomly fade away on vehicles My final straw was my first time trying to relocate a building crashed the game and I lost an hour of work autosaves arent on by default who knew LOL

In case anyones curious i get lowest fps 45 highest fps 90 using 4090 OC and 13900ks

Ill update my review if the game gets in better shape",neg
949230,Sadly the Game launched way to early Game is still in dev The FPS we have in the game is just super bad Even in an empty city spectating nothin 60fps arent possible,neg

There is very little added to keep me entertained after a while It seriously just feels like a modded version of skylines 1 with terrible performance I played up to around 200k pop with the lowest graphics settings and it was crawling",neg
949230,"Games not ready Dont know how this passed through any sort of testing what so ever aside from the game not being optimized there are simple things that are just not in the game other added features dont even work properly like seriously hot the hell does this game get put out to the public as a finished 10 game This is completely Early Access AT BEST Great want me to add water pipes fine make them snap correctly instead all you get are a bunch of open ended lines that connect to nothing and on the map all you see are non connected pipe warnings all over lets see on that same issue at least allow me to destroy them nope cant do that either at least the game glitches and wont let you delete all of them The highlight and delete feature when deleting roads is garbage as well better off clicking a million times to get the feature to work unless your going in a straight line other wise move off the road a little and boom done gone or the route changes no memory of what was previously selected hmmm what else its great to have all the angles and inclines decline degrees etc on the roads when your drawing them but you cant see sht when placing the roads and guess whatYUP THEY LEFT OUT THE FUNCTION to turn it off or reduce opacity at least like really guys what else Oh yeah i forgot no ability to select what roads i want to have buildings on and no grid to see when placing either like guys is this the DTeam putting this game together why are you leaving the game is such a horrible state that you are going to require the community to fix your errors and add the things that should already be in the base game even if you wanted to make the screen cleaner or what ever BS idea some noob had in their heads you need to give the player the options here why yall leaving options out of a game seriously yall gave us so many and and left the QOL ones out love paradox but yall fkn failed

Mark my words all of these features will be released behind the DLC paywall or the community will have to mod them into the game",neg

949230,I dont usually write reviews but this is a game that I have been waiting for since the announcement of release Although they have fixed the performance issues the game is still kinda bad The progression is absolutely stupid and all you need to do in order to progress is spam build and destroy one building and your max level The way that the demand is set up just makes absolutely no sense either why does the basic residential constantly go up and no matter what it does not go down the maps as well are just not great either compared to the first game and it sucks This game is such a let down as someone who put a lot of hours into cities skylines 1 I dont understand why it is so hard to do anything and the demand for stuff is just terrible I really hope that the devs have plans to fix this because it is really not fair to everyone who bought the game and now cant refund it Fix this shitty game please its horrible in its current state,neg
949230," Removed Spasm radio ad due to offensive content

People are complaining about terrible performance when the game released Instead of using all their recources to fix this most glaring problem which a game this expensive shouldnt even get sold with in the first place they set this as their priority Do you really think people arent tired enough of this already Its a game not a goverment website

Im not supporting this so expect me buying my DLCs from sites you make zero profit from until i see change

1086940,"im just gonna bite the bullet on this one

you get a nuke implanted in your head if you die the nuke will not go off

so obviously everyones first thought is to go towards a major population center

great now everyone is a murderous psychopath except laezel she had a plan and from an outsiders perspective its compelling

oh wait shes a murderslave cult worshiping psychopathwho didnt even know enough about her people to judge them correctly so now shes a stupid as in narratively tenuous murderous psychopath 

so now i dont really care how you act or what you saybecause you all deserve to die including the pc well i gotta keep playing the game i guess ill dissociate from the narrative

oh wait fuck im playing fucking 5e where you either abuse mechanics so hard it causes DM knife fights or you get absolutely steamrolled

im 1000 convinced people dont actually play 5e they just see it as a commodity fetish of Nerdishness to worship the other 000001 like it because they get to abuse the mechanics or because no one wants to learn a different game because it would admit that 5e isnt perfect",neg

1086940,"Definitely a full skip on this one whats good about the game is the graphics and character creation as they give you plenty of options when it comes to spicing up your character as well lots of classes to choose from and thats about it
Story is mediocre and determined by pointless rng through dice rolls that encourage reloading your game over and over you only have 4 characters out of the many to choose from and if you dont have a specific character in your party you will miss important story 
The worst part of the game is the combat which is the important partthe system itself should be scrapped and redone almost all of the abilities that mean anything are limited to 12 encounters forcing you to restencounters take way to long the movement system is a waste of time as you wont be able to attack an enemy even if your right in front of them literally which happens every encounter bugs prevent progress in certain fights that prevent you from targeting enemys 
Highly suggest just watching the cutscenes somewhere and save yourself plenty of time if the combat was overhauled then you got something here",neg

1086940,fuck off with all the forced downloads of updates I only get 20 mins at a time to play the game and most of that is now stuck waiting for crap addons,neg
1086940,This game was half decent until the developers decided it was a great idea to make the game EVEN FUCKING BIGGER THAN IT WAS BEFORE how the holy fucking christ in hell do you expect anyone to maintain constant 20gig updates on a game thats already over a hundred gigs The game itself is now over 120 gigs which is just completely fucking ridiculous considering the only things thats changing is fixes for constant day 1 issues      Looks Like its time to play baldurs gate 2 again until this game gets reduced in size by at least 40 gigs  ,neg

Glad that I used my 70 to buy indie games and other games FPS  other genres that the Devs do care for their games

Hopefully Treyarch still have time for their own game to make zombies better",neg
1938090,The MW3 Campaign is by far the worst COD Campaign I have ever played The Open Combat Missions ruined the whole COD campaign experience for me It wouldve been okay having just having 2 or 3 OCMs throughout the campaign but when half the campaign is just OCMs doing the same stuff over and over again it gets old and annoying really fast There was only a few non OCMs that I enjoyed and thats it The gun play isnt bad the AI are annoying though Anytime you tried sneaking up on a enemy in ANY Open Combat Mission they would instantly be alerted so stealth wasnt an option much when I played at least Ending was terrible they killed Soap AGAIN which doesnt add up to the story at all Dont waste your money on this game Its a copy and paste of MW2 and the next game will be a copy paste of MW3 save yourself and your money,neg

1938090,Update requires restart,neg
1938090,i wanted to like it but the campaign just fell flat the open world concept was a good one off  after seeing that most of the campaign is that with only one or two fun set pieces with some nostalgia bait thrown in I have left thoroughly unimpressed All you had to do was build off the original concept and take a risk or two but instead you decided to go in the most safe bland and uninspired way for a series that is usually narrative driven for its solo setting Nothing of significance happens save for one event that most anyone could see coming if ya want it for the story just skip it the devs sure as fuck did,neg

1172470,"Apex Legends is not for casuals 

Only professional gamers streamers and sweatlords who desperately want to be streamers play Apex on a daily basis  If you arent playing like them youre gonna get destroyed pretty fucking hard on every single confrotation There is no room to think and planify 

For all of them every single aspect in Apex is taken so serious they feel entitled They treated Apex Legends as a national esport one wrong move ex not landing on a high contested POIs and youll get verbally destroyed by your teammates Thinking outside of the box is a blasphemy to them

The MMRSBMM whatever matchmaking Respawn is using is the worst experience ever  Unless you have amazing skills youll lose a series of matches in a row 100 Guarantee Then the game will put you into an easier lobby so you get a couple of kills and after that match Respawn will send you to high skilled lobbies for you to lose more Wow What an amazing system Respawn So fair and balanced  And of course the fans are okay with this Protect the lower skilled players my ass  Respawns MMR takes those low skilled players to feed the more talented players and streamers and I know because Im one of the low skilled players Even with an overall 1KD Respawn will make sure youll get fucked by better gamers against your skills even you have the worst KDs and you feel your skills arent up to the challenges

Speaking of match making every lobby either pubs or ranked feels like the biggest tournament even conceived  If you try to have fun in the lobby by that I mean not play the exact same way the progamersstreamerssweaties are playing you lose Simple as that And then when you try something else they dont like ex play strategically with placements and loot youll receive toxic abuse There is no middle ground in this game As long as heirlooms recolours are selling high Respawn seems okay with a toxic community

Its sad really because the gameplay is one of the best FPS around there is not another game close to what Apex is offering except Titanfall 2 in some ways

Having fun in a videogame is a foreign concept at Respawn and its community as a whole seems to agree with the devss vision

I dont often write reviews but I feel compelled to express my disappointment with Season 18

The matchmaking system is seriously flawed In many instances I find myself pitted against either lowlevel cheaters or seasoned predators which has seriously hampered the enjoyment for my friends and me And this is on nonAsian servers I can only imagine what the experience would be like there

Regarding the ingame shop and events the offerings have been lackluster at best It seems that Respawn and EA are attempting to recoup losses from Seasons 16 and 17 but the current state of the game provides little incentive for financial investment This is coming from someone who has purchased over 1200 gold skins and 22 heirlooms If things continue this way I foresee a significant decline in the player base and its disappointing that the developers dont seem to acknowledge this

The gameplay itself has become so unbalanced that it encourages teaming which in my view undermines the competitive nature of the game Its evident that the studios focus has shifted away from the needs and experiences of average players Ive decided to step back from the game for now and will consider returning once improvements have been made

From a greatly disappointed player


Sep 21st 2023

Are you out of your freaking mind WTF WTF is this normal game mode Do not force your customers to play shift There is no loot And fix your freaking match making system If you knew the old map is shift thats why you changed it dramatically dont just put it back in a even worse form You want money I get it and you know the easiest way to get money for you Make players like your game Not Making them QUIT 

Previously you had the decency to allow players to choose what to play normal or some horseshift mode This time What is wrong with you Respawn STOP FEEDING US SHIFT  Have you learnt nothing since the last time this game has died

The mechanics have been more streamlined and I personally found the combat to be more fun with the Venom abilities
The campaign is much short and the world remains mostly the same save for a winter coat on the whole city 

The story was mostly passable but no too memorable But I cant comment on its ending because this game is extremely glitchy And Im unable to load my save file without crashing the game

This crash issue had previously happened when I tried to redo certain challenge missions or load the last checkpoint from the menu But at least after restarting the game would let me resume from my last save point

However in the final mission the game steps up its bugginess I died during one of the fights and while the game was loading my last checkpoint it crashed again
I tried restarting the game and loading my save file multiple times But the game just keeps crashing over and over

However Ive refunded within a few hours The constant NoError and Outdated GPU Driver crashes are a nightmare After trying every fix recommended online and visiting more forums than my search history can handle theres just no way forward
The game is actually so good that I would perhaps reconsider buying it again in the future and spend even more time looking for as fix as if I didnt spend enough time already Id actually even be willing to post a brand new positive Review after finding a fix Sigh this really is disappointing",neg

1091500,"There is a lot of depth to the world tons of stuff to do even more if you get the DLC Has a high amount of replayability The parade quest was one of the most immersive and cool game experiences Voice acting is great characters are intriguing and you get to run around with Keanu Reeves the whole time

Only thing Id knock it for is performance Its good enough to be playable and not detract from the gameplay but it definitely could and should be better",pos

1091500,As fun as it gets Fastpaced fighting and cool story,pos
1091500,Easily one of the best games ever The story line is AMAZING I can forgive minor little glitches here and there because the story line is THAT GOOD The new Phantom Liberty release was a great addition not my favorite ending but it was still awesome to play I have played through the entire game twice now I will be playing through a 3rd time Cant wait for a sequel,pos

1091500,Night City is the single most mesmerizing openworld setting I have ever had the joy of interacting with The fancy graphics and flashy gameplay are only the cherry on top to absolutely superb art and sound design an excellent soundtrack and unforgettable characters The story is decent yet short in length but where Cyberpunk 2077 truly shines is in its world Night City does not need gimmicks to immerse you into its world No random encounters no birds to guide you to treasure Just a broken dirty stunning dystopia for you to explore,pos
1091500,"56 hours in now  Not even close to finishing the game This game is jammed pack full of contents 

I guess im glad i waited so many years before buying it

My advice Dont buy starfield Buy this instead Its better in LITERALLY every ways",pos

If you are thinking about getting this game get it It is 100 worth every penny
I played the game at 1440p Medium settings at 4060 fps I also completed all content and achievements 

The Good
 Storyworld is immersive
 Amazing combat 
 Skill tree to make combat your own stealth gun nut net runner are just some options
 Best graphics in any game so far
 Updated Police and driving
 dialogue makes characters feel like actual characters and not just an NPC there to further a plot point
 You get to make your own choices in certain situations like dealing with gangs endings your hit list
 Hours of content
 Hardcore modding community to make the game even better

The bad 
 Still not the game that was promised
 End game is a little disappointing your ending doesnt change anything about the game It just puts you back before you did the ending you wanted
 DLC story is a little underwhelming feels like a different iteration of V and Jackie
 level scaling
 Lower end hardware will struggle a bit and may have to use FSR and low settings to be at 60 
 Some game breaking glitches the one i found was patched in the 202 update",pos
1091500,Was a pretty fun game but I havent played since the new dlc and now i cant even get the game to start up It just instantly flatlines and closes out of the game screen on loadup any help would be appreciated Ive tried uninstalling,neg
1091500,"I was about to write a really long review for you to sit through and read without any skip option but then my review would be just like the first 4 hours of this game 

The mechanics are like a 810 I like it I wish we could see more of them over the trailing dialogue and extremely long unskippable cutscenes

Not even to mention the Braindances imagine watching a 2 minutes video over 3 times in 3 different shades of color with unskippable dialogue from your VERY CHARMING storypals Then in each of the 3 runthroughs of the video you have to stop and point your camera at a glowing object for 5 seconds so the game registers it a background character goes through a 20 second dialogue about how the object has no correlation with what youre after then youre back to scanning

God its just thrilling gameplay I dont think even the people who play this game for its story likes Braindances Just God awful The real shame is itd actually be really cool if the characters that are supposed to be stonecold cyber gangsters would just shut the fuck up for a second and let me figure shit out for myself The constant chatter on my phone drives me fucking nuts

In summation its a good game Its worth the price I feel wrong leaving a NOT RECOMMENDED review but I feel like theres too much praise given Theres a TON of the game where I just pull out my phone and pop on Youtube for literally MINUTES One time I started a cutscene went to take a piss came back and the characters were silently watching the city from a taxi it wasnt skippable and its neat and all but GOD DAMMIT PUT IN A FUCKING SKIP BUTTON

AHHHHH SOMETIMES I WANT TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES TO PLAY THE VIDEO GAME NOT WATCH A MOVIE Again I feel bad knocking the game but WHAT THE FUCK",neg
