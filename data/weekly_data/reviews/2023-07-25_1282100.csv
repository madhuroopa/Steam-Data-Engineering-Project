review,voted_up
"Nice game, just as good as the first but probably a bit easier than first game.  Playing on veteran in team of 2 and the bosses are fairly easy compared to last game.",True
"The game is great and its certainly an upgrade from the first one; adding classes, a whole lot more of equipment allowing build variety, new ways to implement secrets, and complex map designs with verticality!
However some cons i've found in comparison to its predecessor is elite enemies seem to only spawn in occasionally instead of being preloaded into the world, there very little interaction within Ward 13 and the story overall well.... was just ""go fetch the segments, anomaly.""
Regardless of all this, i enjoy the game and this review is only after a single playthrough of the campaign, so opinion may change!",True
"fuN AND FULL OF PUZZLING LEVELS, HOPE YOUR CREATIVE",True
kinda gives Destiny/Dark souls vibes. Pretty fun game with diffrent maps and choices,True
Bloodbourne w guns,True
"Take outriders, make it repayable with near perfect co-op, now add some crazy cool environments and you've got Remnant 2. This is gonna be my top game for a while.",True
"Its like the first game but with SO much more. If you liked the first game then this is a no brainer, if you didn't play the first then this is still a great place to start",True
This is a great game.  You wont be disappointed in this purchase,True
I love it!!!!,True
This game makes me want to hang myself,True
yes,True
"Good gunplay, harder than the first game but not unfair. Dual archtyping and 4 rings give a lot more customization options for builds (hopefully they'll add loadouts though as changing them can be cumbersome). Definately worth the purchase, even more so once they patch out some of the progression bugs currently holding it back from being a 10/10 to a 9/10.",True
"Great game play and amazing replay-ability. The archetype system is awesome and the games is full of entertaining secrets that are normally very rewarding. the variety of armor and weapons is great and definitely better than the first although they are not always easy to find. You can no longer upgrade armor and there are no longer really any bonuses to wearing a complete set, but they make up for it pretty well with the variety of relics, amulets, rings, and traits. My main gripe is that weapons are mostly hard to find, if you aren't finding secrets you aren't finding many new weapons or armor, but you will have like 50 rings at the end of your first play-through if you don't explore much.",True
guud game,True
"This is a great game except for one huge Caveat the last boss is utter garbage i did not buy Remnant to play a rythym game which is what the last boss is which is not what i Bought. through the whole game you did not need to make the boss's into rythym fights to be hard and then the last boss is just utter trash i was originally looking forward to replaying this game many times now i have no desire as i have no desire to ever do the last boss again. so in essence:
ENTIRE GAME OTHER THAN LAST BOSS 100% GAME OF THE YEAR
LAST BOSS: UTTER TRASH whoever designed should be fired",True
"Made a hard core character with friends, got to lvl 5, died in Yeasha by falling off a tree root bridge with bad geometry.
Made another hardcore character, died to one shot boss mechanic.
Made another hardcore character, fell through an elevator while emoting and died.
Made another hardcore character, (discovered dual class is a thing this time) got to the Labrynthe with a friend - went through a teleport gate. The teleport gate was a trap and the platform you land on falls out underneath both of us. We both died. Almost vomited from laughing so hard.

12/10 game will play again.",True
gud,True
best coop shooter man has ever witnessed in this feckless lifetime,True
I NEED TO GET ARCHON,True
"This game is caked up for Co-op. Get you a friendo or 2 and have a blast. This game rocks for duos, I really enjoy alot of the exploration and stuff with another homie having your back. Singleplayer is also fine too, but it feels a bit less exciting.",True
"At the hour and a half mark, I'm stuck at a specific room because it would crash me every time I load in. Game breaking bug for some, I guess I'm just unfortunate enough to experience it as my first Remnant game.",False
"If you can get the game to load without the UR engine crashing, load into your game without it crashing, and joining your friend's game without it crashing, then you are lucky. I have an RTX 3070 TI, with a 13th gen i9-13900KF 3.00 GHz processor, with a liquid cooling system. I played Remnant: From The Ashes twice, once on Xbox, then again on pc when I converted, with literally hundreds of hours. It is so unfortunate that this game is so poorly optimized. Had a blast the first night playing with my friend until the first crash a couple of hours in. Now it is unplayable with my friend(who also has a worse rig than I do, and has had it crash once). Every time you move to a different area, crashes. Lowered to the lowest settings, tried different launch options, and tried overclocking/under-volting, but nothing has fixed it. Literally never launches on the first try. If you're lucky, 1 out of 10 times will launch. Until they put a patch out to fix this, I can't recommend this game. I have never had any problems with any other games I have tried on this PC that I got for Christmas, and I understand 3070 is far from the top of the line, but also far from the bottom.",False
dark souls with guns 2,False
"so ill give it it was a fun time, i enjoyed it for 60 hours and i actually liked every point of it minus a boss called the nightweaver which has a rampant misuse of instant kills and awful hitboxes for them. What really did it for me and why im even bothering to make this is my save file got corrupted. I dont have any mods i just play with my homies. At first i noticed the game didn't give me rewards or credit for beating the story mode; okay that's fine ill just do it again. Suddenly i have negetive 60 trait points, once again fine im sure it'll fix itself if i use an orb of undoing to reset the points (I looked it up and that actually hyperfucks you into having permanently 0 skill points). Lastly suddenly i have no secondary class or consumables or skills. The only way to fix any of this is to go into the games files and revert the save which guess what; the game not giving me credit for the story was like 30 hours ago and the trait points going negative was like 10ish hours ago so there's no fixing that but sure ill go back a save file or two to have a second class again but oops turns it saved from me going in and out of the game seeing if just resetting would fix it so the file is just fucked until they patch it.  For a $60 (I paid $70 i wanted to support this game) this is a pretty damn big bug to allow into a full release.",False
Performance kinda sucks right now. Will update if they fix.,False
"corrupted character after 40 hours of gameplay, which made me lose all progress, at times infuriating enemy archetypes, most enemies have no sort of weakspot due to having helmets, no head, or things of that nature. most bosses are challenging and enjoyable, but some have some of the most annoying and downright BS mechanics. Do not recommend the game just because you can randomly lose your progress",False
"My save got corrupted half way through the game and i lost everything, just get dark souls theres a reason its called souls like.",False
"This is a 10/10 game that I am giving a 3/10 score.  I'll change based on how they address my concerns.  I waited several days to write this as I was hoping they would target this bug before I spent too much time disappointed by  it.  I got the bug that mysteriously gives me a lot of negative trait points out of nowhere.  I tried to reason it out between strange load times or me Alt+F4ing in a strange instance, but nobody seems to know why this happens.  

I am still loving this game after creating a new character, but I was really hoping such a progression based bug would be stomped quickly.  It has not been and it's extremely disappointing.  My bugged character was allowed to continue to collect trait points, and my power level continued to rise as I leveled up my weapons and archetypes, but without being able to spend my trait points while they are in a negative balance, my character is handcuffed and under powered for the content I want to play.  My archetype and gun levels boost my power level, and yet I have 20 trait points I cannot spend which would really help my character keep up with others doing dmg, heals, or tactical moves.  I felt weak.

Yeah, re-rolling a new character is a way around it, but with how the game is randomized I no longer have the weapons, rings, mods, etc that I once had which is an extreme buzzkill.  I understand they are dealing with a successful launch and have priorities, but this one seems like it should be addressed before anything else, and yes I am salty about it.  Get it together so I can enjoy my character!!! I will say this has not happened to my 2nd character, but the game re-rolled my starting world as a different version and then also the next one so I got to play a ton of the same type of content but was forced out of the items I loved and wanted.  Not a good experience.

Again, the game is at it's core: FUNNNN  I'll change my review based off of how they address these things.",False
"Good game, horrible performance especially when playing with friends. Anytime anyone picks up any loot the fps drops to 0 for a split second. This a looter shooter.",False
"bought the ultimate edition... doesnt have the gunslinger. 
",False
"You will only see good things about this game everywhere... My 2 takeaways from this game: They need to fix the perfomance issues and add content. Yes, it's fun for a few days, you get to shoot bad guys!!! Community is overshilling, tbh you guys are annoying. Paid over 100 Canadian dollars to play this early.

Here's my review 
Performance: crashes, overheats my 3070
Content: Lacking
Story: Ok. The world design and characters you encounter are somewhat inspired.
Environments are nice but empty. The resource gathering is super basic >occasional scrap drop from enemies >OK now u can go upgrade.  
Now I just want my money back...",False
"This worked great for a few days, put about 35 hours in with a couple of minor crashes here and there....for some reason today it won't run for more than 5 minutes without crashing, running a 4070ti it crashes before the fans even turn on...not sure what changed, but now the game is unplayable. Great game while it's playable.",False
"got to final boss, it bugged now game broke :(",False
"15 hours in and my my equipment was lost, all earned items just removed. Not worth if there isn't a fix.",False
I have a high end system.  Top 95% according to steam poll. I also loved the original Remnant from the ashes. I pre-purchased the ultimate edition of the game based on that love. I was excited to get to play 3 days early... well i guess that was just a gimmick to get some free play testers instead actually hiring some before release. I'm not sure when it happened that so many people lately are ok with unfinished AAA titles at release? As for me I expect it to work if I'm going to shell out $70 for it. I mean that should be the minimum of reasonable expectation.  I would like for the game to be good as well... but it should at least work. The first 5 days I could not play beyond character creation... many others have the same issue. others experience frequent crashes at different times... and they clearly meet the minimum specs. (and what does minimum specs even mean nowadays? does that only count for 3 months after release and they fix the game breaking bugs and crashes?) honestly its not even complete as they are still working on implementing some of the features that used to be included day 1. I get it that the industry has been rocked by covid laziness including a desire to not show up to work and sit on the couch and smoke... but if you can't get your coders to perform than fire them and hire someone that wants to get paid for working. And for all things Holy stop releasing trash games before they are ready! Hire some play testers or something... heck I'll volunteer I'd love to make extra money testing games across multiple platforms. I for one will not lower my standards simply because of a lack of good games at this time. Consider this Balders Gate 3 releases tomorrow... and I'm willing to bet I don't experience all the game breaking performance issues as I have with this one. Why are they different? Are they better and more capable than you? or do they just give a rip about the quality of their product?,False
"Scaling is an issue, you never feel strong, even if you collect all the best items, because devs did a mistake by scaling monsters damage, HP, and then scale it again in coop play.

Some enemies feel spongy, but the bigger problem is the one shots that are unmitigateable.",False
"I get it.  Everyone is desperately looking for something new.  But come on people, this isn't it.  It is literally no different than the first Remnant.  I also have no idea in the world how this became Steam Deck Verified????  It runs like hot garbage on the lowest settings available.",False
Fuck the sewers.,False
Repeatedly suffered nausea while playing. Too bad.,False
"Player feels too slow, overall controls feel clunky and delayed. It seems like it takes a half second for dodging to actually dodge, which may or may not negate damage (feels like it's random whether or not the character takes damage from the boss mid dodge).",False
