1282100,much good very wow,pos
1282100,"So far Ive been enjoining this game I want to make clear that Im not a soul game fan but this game has a different vibe is definitely worth it This game took me by surprise I was looking to play a good single player game because unfortunately we are not having good ones lately a lot of game developers are focusing in multiplayer games with micro transactions but this game is very good I recommended for those that like the challenge of dying a couple of times Lol Im blown away by the graphics too Im playing this in a C2 OLED 42 and man is a pleasure to the eyes Im definitely looking forward to check this game developers to see what other games they can create This review came from a very picky person in terms of which game to play and enjoy sometimes I buy games to let them sit for ever because I didnt like it

PLEASE Gunfire Games make an action and adventure game inspire in The last of us type of game with a really good story dont only focus in soul games inspired in Dark Souls I think you guys have a very very good potential in creating something awesome you guys surprise me with the graphics etc I pay attention to the details and in some areas you guys beat a lot of big developers in my opinion",pos
1282100,Please give me RNG blessing,pos
1282100,Very fun with friends as long as you keep your power levels close falling behind by 3 or 4 levels can be really crippling Some of the boss fights are very fun with cool attacks There are a few too many unreactable attacks Iframes on dodges feel inconsistent if you are not the host Performance leaves much to be desired even on high end hardware On ultra performance fsr the game still looks rather good During combat I notice there are quite a few micro stutters and combining that with the iframe issue playing as non host can feel rather helpless at times,pos
1282100,Really good if looking for a challenge,pos
1282100,great game,pos
1282100,"Very good exploration and replayability Tons of secret quests and puzzles to look up on youtube for how to solve 
Combat is very fun with all the different weapons However it feels like a pain the butt at times because whenever you want to heal use your skill or mod there is always that delay And I know you can use rings and items to speed up the process but whats the point of having that mechanic in the game It doesnt improve the gaming experience whatsoever and just feels like artificial difficulty For example If I want to use my class skill or a weapon mod or heal during a boss battle I have to wait for openings to do one action at a time because it takes a million years instead of being able to perform all those actions quickly So annoying
Lastly screw the last boss annihilation Whoever designed that battle needs to be tied up and tickled to death 
Overall still a super fun game",pos
1282100,20 hours in and Im loving it The combat and exploration are so satisfying   While the story is not deep I like the characters and voice acting its enough to make me care about and feel in this world,pos
1282100,Darksouls with Guns Whats not to love,pos
1282100,Combat feels good Game provides plenty of challenge Tons of secrets and random tile sets for dungeon keeps the game fresh Tons of loot and customization so you can play how you feel comfortable Souls like game style You do not need to play previous games to feel apart of the story,pos

1282100,I like it sorta Has a lot of little problems that just wear you down after a while Game goes stale long before you unlock everything which defeats the purpose of replaying the game Worse yet most unlocks are junk IDK man needs to be balanced so all the play styles have a home Dodging isnt all that fun,neg

1282100,"This game is great in so many areas but theres one thing that killed it for me Trait points capped

Unlike the previous game which had unlimited trait points this one has a cap of 65 So you can max out 65 skill trees before you cant progress anymore So after a playthrough and some multiplayer sessions Im capped out

In the previous game you could keep rerolling your campaign and keep helping friends and strangers on bosses and keep leveling up and being incentivized to keep playing and beating the same bosses sometimes But in this game unless its a new boss or a new area I have no reason to play it and you find yourself in the same area a lot

They recently raised the cap from 60 to 65 but thats not enough Its not a PvP game Me leveling up after putting hours in should be allowed And unlike the last game theres not many traits and the ones they do have arent very good",neg
1282100,Game ran fine at launch most recent update killed it Doesnt run for shit now My computer is constantly over heating I tried using Geforce which originally ran it at optimal settings i scaled it all the way back down to Performance and it still runs like shit Button input has a delay when I click shit it misclicks screen is constantly stuttering I changed priority of it to real time to see if that would help it didnt Game is completely unplayable They need to fix their shit,neg
1282100,I cannot recommend this game anymore would have enjoyed giving a glowing review but as it crashed onceand completely deleted my profile of nothing but grinding out a pure archer build im extremely disgusted and sad even after doing a various few workaround fixes it didnt matter After reverifying game files and making sure that the cloud data was accurate i reloaded the game and lost everything,neg
1282100,"If youre looking for Remant From the Ashes this isnt it While the game looks nice Ive spent many hours on the first game and at 20 hours Ive realized a few things

 We just hit the final boss yesterday After looking up all the available weapons we are missing about 80 of them This isnt like the first game or like dark souls where you get a choice between a boss weapon or a mod  90 of the mains story bosses drop mods and not weapons
 If you dont play with a guide doing everything step by step you miss out of 80 of the game We have been following the mains story branching off to everything we can find Which come to find out playing just the story and immediate side quests results in pretty much nothing No cool weapons at all
 There is so much dialogue choices for every single NPC I just dont understand how the first game was awesome in your face while this one has you reading books everywhere NPCs is way too much to say with little to no impact on the game or your decisions and it overall feels like a chore to slog through it all
 I cant fathom the design to put weapons and gear through muddled secrets that you would need to pull up guides for every step if the way We ACCIDENTALLY found a gun with some beacon side quest which we could have screwed up at any time If i spend 20 minutes in a boss fight who has a really neat looking weapon and moveset to come out with a mod that shoots tentacles then it wasnt worth it
 Were going through on veteran because the Nightmare wasnt available until you finish the game Thank god for that or else we probably wouldnt have figured out how not fun and cool this game which we though was just going to be a beefed up Remnantn From the Ashes to such a disappointing slog
 Bosses are insanely aggravating and Ive finished every dark soulsdemons souls Those games make you understand your weakness This game makes you think youre doing the right thing putting points in a useless slot only to find that their attack hitboxes are far bigger that they show on screen oh and they will non stop swing until youre dead with no interruptions I cant learn from bad design
 There hidden classes that you have to do some arbitrary nonsense that no casual or sane gamer would ever figure out I paid for a game and have to play lets watch a YouTube to find out how to do this instead of just enjoying my playthrough

This isnt on the same level as the first game Knowing what i know now I would have skipped this and went and replayed the first one I kept telling myself next boss will have a weapon over and over again until there wasnt anymore bosses left to get to through what I can only assume a normal person who buys the game will encounter

Its a shame This was on my radar the moment it was announced and I wish I could refund the copies I bought for me and a friend After 20 hours of saying next one will be the turning point it just never delivered",neg
1282100,"This game based on gameplay alone should be a 10 game  I attempted to refund however it takes about 8 hours to realize how lackluster this game is

Gear system is as awful as it could possibly be  You dont come across new armor or weapons as you play  You just upgrade the first weapon you ever get  Its that bad

Tried Medic  My dps is ok for clearing areas but the first boss I found Legion Regenitor would have taken me 40 minutes of flawless dodging gameplay to beat solo  Im forced to play online which would be ok except 

Tried online play  You start off dead watching others play when you join  Bafflingly stupid idea  Sometimes I wait up to 15 minutes to finally join the fight  Most of my online play so far has been spent spectating  Also medic skills are lackluster at healing allies during a fight  My heals are wasted if my teammates dont see it

The game uses the same upgrade system as dark souls meaning EVEN IF new gear was always dropping you wont use 95 of the stuff you find bc its not upgraded yet  

Experience is VERY slow and you dont obtain much from leveling  You only get like 3 skills by reaching max level and you can only use 1 skill at a time  LOL  I actually googled how to equip more than more skill when I found this out thinking it couldnt possibly be true  This kills motivation to level up and continue playing especially when combined with the fact that you arent coming across new weapons and armor to provide those dopamine hits

Ultimately serves me right for paying 50 for a video game and expecting it to be good in this age of AAA disasters  What a scam",neg
1282100,I want to play this game so bad from the review it seems like a good game No this game is practically unplayable its borderline impossible to play with the crashes and lag for reference i have a i7 12700KF and a 3070ti and I can run the game but as soon as there is a combat sequence it freezes and take for ever to unfreeze and by the time it does ive died I dont know if its a poorly optimize or what,neg
1282100,This game is a lot of fun Especially with friends But recently something happened and we can no longer join each others games Weve tried multiple solutions but nothing works rendering the game basically unplayable for us as we dont want to play singleplayer If this gets fixed Ill probably change to an upvote but this is something I expect from an earlyaccess game not a full release,neg
1282100,"Dear Devs

If your game is a full of crashes and you have no intentions of fixingplease make the final boss encounter not a hour long

regards",neg
1282100,"Very Good game I love it I sunk many hours in this game with my friends and did all you can do except for 1 thing
There is a game breaking bug at the end that makes the boss not spawn It spawned on my first try but then after the second face it glitched and now it wont spawn back It gave me the achievment for killing him but i never did because he never spawned So now im stuck on the last quest and cant complete the game Im not going to go back and play the entire campaign over again thats just silly I would wait tell this is fixed before you play the game",neg
1282100,"I find I dont like it I have played and won Elden ring  which I liked  Elden ring gave you different ways to compete You could run you could sneak or you could full out fight
Remnant 2 is just full out constant attack attack  attack  I can see that a lot of people like that but sorry its not for me",neg
1282100,CLOUD SAVE ERRORS CONSTANTLY,neg
1282100,"What could be an okay to solid game a breath of fresh air in this sea of overly focustested shareholder appeasing sea of modern titles is severely held back by its abysmal performance
Running a Ryzen 3900x RTX 3070ti and 32 GB RAM it usually stays around 4060 FPS with terrible frame timings at literally any settings
Yes you read that right whether you run it at lowest settings or ultra it runs exactly the same FSR somewhat improves the frame pacing but has no FPS benefit either No DLSS is not an option and youll see why if you read further
If that wasnt enough over the course of a session 2 hours it will accumulate and leak VRAM slowing down the already barely playable performance then eventually grinding to a near halt if you dare open any menu
This can be staved off a bit by not using your inventorytradersetc unless necessary but you will eventually find yourself with literally 12 FPS forcing you to restart the game

Now the crme de la crme
For a game whose developers argue that their game was built with upscaling in mind DLSS has never ever worked It has been disabled in the options menu since early release and forcing it to load the corresponding DLL hangs the game with an EXCEPTIONSTACKOVERFLOW on launch effectively killing it

With the last update it has been force enabled without my influence and I cannot launch the game anymore period
Thank you Gunfire Games for these wellthoughtout decisions

TLDR Possibly solid game but awful to unplayable performance on high end hardware also the game might never run for you",neg
1282100,this game this game this game uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh this game uhm game this in the what it is has she him this game and its on an in un me you her him she he they them huh players play moon sun planet uno in the of the your many listenings in the hat of time wonderous creatures and hats the light the darknes and the homes of reality in wich we bleed and cry eating goosbumps and images of cats,neg
1282100,Fun game runs like shit though,neg
1282100,"As much as I love Remnant and the community this release is a technical disaster Memory management problems resulting in crashes on higher end hardware that require you to disable overclocking presets Horrid performance for the given hardware even when maximizing DLSSstyle technology is another issue And on top of all that there are still some crucial bugs that can actively require a restart to fix more so when playing with others

It is painfully obvious that the devs bit off far more than they could chew The game looks gorgeous but the price you pay in performance due to incredibly shoddy optimization is not worth it for the average consumer and unless you are extremely active in the community and want to go in spoiler free I do not recommend getting this game until it gets sorted if at all

For reference my 4090 7800x3d setup would in one area dip into the 40s at 1080p with DLSS performance so effectively rendering at 540p that is beyond unacceptable",neg
1282100,Play Elden Ring,neg
1282100,"The archetypes are fun 

Story is meh I tried to care and still couldnt find any interest We get edgy teenage angst character 4533 while pretty much every other character falls of entirely after meeting them 5 minutes earlier Bo That guy Oh yeah I forgot about him doing stuff at Ward 13 

Movement is still clunky and feels like youre kneedeep in mud all the time and the boss fight designs are absolutely terrible when you pair it with the horrible feeling of the movement The weapon variety still feels really lacking and fumbling around with the goofy button combinations was frustrating I cant tell you how many times Ive used my relic when I wanted to use an archetype ability playing on controller or doubletapped a weapon ability just for it to click off then take the second to switch BACK all while getting beat on 

Boss fights just drown you out in screen clutter Boss animations are hidden behind fogs and little mists and massive unnecessary constant screen clutter The actual fights themselves are just a lame checklist of things you need to do inbetween damage windows Dont fall off this thing Run around this pillar constantly and kite adds while breaking the bosss lineofsight LOOK THIS BOSS FLIES TOO ISNT IT COOL 

Plan on playing a companion class like handler or summoner Your companions are just going to follow you around doing absolutely nothing if there is any sort of flight involved in the fight or just get stuck on a piece of terrainwallfloor for the entirety Pet micro is a pretty lame feature its not something you can simultaneously do while firing your weapon or dodging around in combat If I want to tell my pet to attack a specific target I need to stop ADS and any type of dodging or rolling then perform a long animation all while not doing anything else to get my companion to attack a specific target all while not firing a round because thatll interrupt the process and nothing will happen

If you were into the first Remnant I can say youll dig this one too If youre into Dark Souls and though Oh cool DS with guns Give it a wide miss",neg
1086940,Probably the best game of the decade,pos
1086940,Fantastic game been loving it so much lets hope for some more games from Larian like this,pos
1086940,"Is it the best game ever made probably not

Is it the absolute best game I have played in years Hands down

Full complete featurefilled game made by a team with a clear passion for game development 
There are no micro transactions no battle passes no larian currency to convert to gems to buy legendary gear in the online shop no cosmetics stripped out of the game and sold back to the player at a premium price 

There were no promises that it will forever change the landscape of gaming no 16 times the whatever nonsense no starkly out of place hollywood stars lending their likeness and likely hampering the budget Its just a fantastic game And when all is said and done it probably will do a fair bit to change the industry in terms of buyer expectation of value in return for money spent

Its not perfect it can be wonky there are bugs as expected in a game this big and its a CRPG so it certainly wont be for everyone But if you like CRPGs and liked Larians other work to date this is a mustbuy",pos

1086940,"This is one of the very few reviews Ive written about any game I have purchased I bought this game nearly 3 years ago when it came available for Early Access I bought the Digital Deluxe Version I played the original two Baldurs Gate games and the Expansions 

Before the game even released I got my moneys worth of what I spent for the Deluxe Version and the Early access was only a fraction of what you can get of the first Act of this game Now that it is here however I have learned that I got every penny back three times over in just a few days and I have only scratched the surface of this games potential and its story telling ability I play with friends family and loved ones a game in a universe I love immensely 

I didnt have to pay for a battle pass I didnt have to pay for another season I dont have the option of microtransactions or anything else other than playing the game I dont need to be online I dont need any of that This is a PURE RPG storytelling game that far exceeds any TripleA game that has come out in the last decade I only wish I had saved up to buy the Collectors edition when it was available I truly truly truly hope they are working on expansions for this game to explore the rest of the Forgotten Realms because if this developer continues on the path they started with this game alone then we for sure will be in for a wild ride  with the rest of the world to explore",pos

Dont let the number 3 scare you off This is a totally standalone game with its own story and world for people to jump into

1086940,Boring as hell turn based combat robot liked characters complicated system check marked everything that makes you go to sleep,neg
1086940,"This is not a bad game but it has serious issues if you are a CRPG nerd like myself

 Vertical in combat adds interesting options
 Voice direction is incredible 
 Constantly trying to get advantage on opponents offers tactical depth
 Companion quests are compelling
 Interesting multiact quests
 Respeccing More games should have this

 Limited minmaxing potential
 Horrible inventory management
 Many battles are trash mob fests that serve only to waste time
 Narrative is muddy at the end of act 2 and through act 3 Characters respond to player choices in ways that dont make a lot of sense and the villains are very bland
 Very limited spell selection
 Mechanics of spells gimped and clear tiers exist that prioritize specific schools over others illusion is not very useful except for very situational builds necromancy has most of its spells removed enchanting is useless
 The action economy leaves some classes in the dust
 Feats are bad There are a few feats that add interesting possibilities for a select few builds but most of the time you are picking vertical scaling via ability points rather than the horizontal scaling of feats 

My biggest complaint was the overabundance of DDisms in the story and the very bland mechanics The demand for high combat effectiveness of each member of the 4 person party means that expressing your character through combat is difficult Most builds will look about the same for each class DOSII actually got this right which is interesting

I did have fun with it I did play it but afterwards I have no desire to go back and play it again I was very excited for this game to release but overall it feels a bit bland 

In summary it is a pretty game which I can barely run on modest hardware that is about knee deep I had fun with it but I would recommend pathfinder if you want to spend a lot of time on a crpg",neg

1086940,"bThis review will contain minor spoilers as I will circumspectly describe some events that happen without giving the full detailsb


This game shows a lot of promise but is bogged down with an assortment of small frustrations that individually could be overlooked but on the whole create a generally negative gameplay experience 

Perhaps the thing that has been most annoying is how poorly optimized this game is for lower end PCs like mine  Even on minimal graphical settings this game ichugsi  There are frequently times when it takes over 5 seconds for a dialogue interaction to start and many times when I enter a new area it can take more than 1015 seconds for the environment to finish loading in  Similar short but noticeable delays occur before andor after nearly every game action including in combat

I have heard that the games release to consoles has been delayed due to simply being unrunnable in an acceptable state and I am not surprised  I have played their previous game Divinity 2 just fine on my computer so whatever they did with that they need to do to this game

Even if set aside the hardware parts of the game theres other things that bog it down  The limit of 4 members in the party can cause issues when you are in multiplayer games because only one person can actually participate in any dialogue and often its the person who wandered into the NPCs talking radius first who controls the choices which can become infuriating when someone wants to play the game a different way than you  Or if someone else is better suited to make the skill check you need Also the more people you have the more youre going to miss out on the plots of the secondary characters since you have to squeeze them into the increasingly smaller number of extra spots 

Not that there seems to be much to them past about 23 hours of gameplay in  NPC plots seem to be very frontloaded comprising up to a half dozen campground interactions at most not including the circumstances of how you meet them in the first place and then they just stop having an impact on the plot remaining silent members of your party unless you specifically speak to them  Sometimes if an NPC has something important to do or say at a specific point in the main plot and you didnt have them in your party theyll just ishow upi without warning or explanation to do their thing  Perhaps this is mostly a problem that I have to finish the first act before they have anything else interesting to say

Which brings us to the next problem  Theres way too much shit to do in this game and very little guidance on how when or why you would be doing it  Too much content is not normally a bad thing but the problem is the way in which it is presented This is not a game you can casually enjoy with or without your friends it is a perplexing slog where you are frequently presented with choices both environmental and dialogue based and essentially expected to figure it out yourself  You have to be constantly paying attention to your surroundings and actively scanning every corner or you are going to miss things that seem unimportant but turn out to not be  

The most hair pulling example that comes to mind is finding an adamantine forge at one point which has no instructions included but rather than requiring adamantine which you find in the same path that leads to said forge it requires a nugget of mithril which you can only find by noticing that there is a big silvery blue rock off the main path that looks like background scenery and requires teleportation magic or a leg breaking jump to reach  You are supposed to break this rock for a nugget of mithril that the game doesnt even tell you that you need  I only found this out because I used a guide  If a game is making me look up a guide it has failed at conveying its desired plot

Oh and then theres a surprise difficult boss fight as a reward for going through all that effort to activate the forge I hope you werent low on HP and resources

This is not the first or only circumstance where you will run yourself ragged trying to complete a poorly explained challenge only to be rewarded with a surprise difficult boss fight  This may be based on a modern tabletop gaming system but they have designed the game like one of the old frustrating CRPGs where save scumming is all but a requirement to complete the game  Many bosses can be figured out after dying to them several times and figuring out their behavior yes but that just pads out the play time and makes everyone involved feel frustrated And you cant just long rest any time you like in this game unlike previous baldurs gate entries because you need to expend finite resources to long rest so many times youll enter a boss fight not at your best condition

And DD 5e the game this is based on is unfortunately a rather shallow mechanical system  It is designed for ease of play not for depth or breadth of options  Translating this to an even more simplified CRPG format compounds the problem Many character levels ups give you absolutely nothing to work with except for an increase in HP and Im pretty sure that casters are supposed to have more spell options and slots than this game allows them  Rogues in particular are absolutely awful about this getting only HP and occasional passive buffs when they level up with almost no active choices about your characters progression

I constantly feel too weak to participate in what the game throws at me even on Story mode the supposed easy difficulty and end almost every serious fight at the end of my ropes and that is not an experience that I would consider conductive to fun any more than experiencing constant feelings of confusion and lack of direction

You also cant path to areas using your map or your minimap you have to laboriously scroll the gameplay map over to a place sometimes rotating it so you can properly target a place you want to go because elevation and slopes abound in this game world and hope it its too far away because theres a maximum distance you can move from your party at any time

So congratulations Larian Studios for managing to recapture the awkward frustrating vibes of the old Baldurs Gate games and their contemporaries of the 90s in this modern era  If you like dying a lot in ways that are nearly impossible to avoid without save scumming or foreknowledge and wandering in circles trying to figure out what to do next before giving up and looking up an online guide youre in the right place 

But Im not

Lets just hope they work out the performance issues at least  because the rest of this seems pretty unsalvageable to players like me without serious changes  I do not think that this game has redefined the modern era of games in any way other than they obviously put real effort into it instead of halfassing the game and filling it with microtransactions  It saddens me that the bar is so low that this game represents a pinnacle of achievement  

I think that they really did work hard on this and that they should be rewarded for their efforts but Id be more impressed if they had created something new instead of just channelling the spirit of 90s CRPG nostalgia with a fresh coat of paint",neg
1086940,Really bad difficulty spikes and a buggy mess when I switch to followers the UI disappears like 40 of the time with no way to do anything forcing me load an earlier save Extremely annoying,neg
1086940,Companions cant participate in conversations and make skill checks in situations where it would be appropriate to do so Why do I have to make the arcana check if Gale is standing right beside me Mage hand and arcane trickster is also an absolute joke the spell doesnt function even close to how it should and they made it so it can only be used once per short rest What the fuck What kind of cantrip can only be used once per short rest They feels more like DoS3 and not BG3 Hopefully mods will be able to fix some of these issues eventually,neg
1086940,game is for total nerds,neg
1086940,"This is honestly my GOTY so far maybe even my favorite game of the past 10 years a beautiful brilliant game once in a generation and an absolute star in the CRPG genre However it has a FATAL FLAW at the moment when it comes to one area that might surprise you which needs immediate attention paid to it by the devs

Steam Cloud is absolutely ridiculously broken for this game and honestly if I could just turn it off and forget about it I would be more than happy to Problem is I bought this game to play on both my windows PC where it runs way better than I ever expected quality optimization FTW and my Steam Deck downloading a colossal download with hardly any compression to play it on both devices I have played about 6 hours into the first act which has been amazing entirely on my PC but noticing that after every previous launchclose the process took longer and longer

Well I now know the culprit Right clicking the game viewing the properties and navigating to the steam cloud section I see that the game can take up up to 16GB  of Cloud save space this is absolute lunacy This is the amount that has to be uploaded every time you quit the game and 5 hours into ACT 1 I already had a 2GB upload each time And for the internet noobs out there this is Upload not download which for the majority of internet connections is a significantly lower rate than their download speed A game with huge save files such as Crusader Kings 3 by Paradox has a max limit of less than 1GB for its entire cloud save space consumption how it accomplishes it is by letting the user choose which saves they want backed up on the cloud by themselves with a checkbox and not well you know uploading every single quicksave and autosave which defaults to 25 each can go much higher in number and every single past save with zero input from the user as to whether they want every single thing including long redundant stuff backed up

I am maybe a quarter of the way into act 1 and where I live rural in a first world country the best internet I can get makes Steam Cloud unusable For folks gaming on one device I suggest turning Steam Cloud off and backing up your saves manually and this is fine in this case But if you are hoping to to a playthrough on both your PC and Steam Deck the game is Verified there FFS part of why I bought it if you have any concerns about the prospect of having to upload a multiple gigabyte file that gets even huger the more you play every single time you close the game or switch devices and have at all limited internet many places in the world data caps exist professional software packages are a fraction of the size of a single attempt to sync this save file at max size absolute absurdity and own both devices and wish to play on both I advise you to stay well away from this game until the devs deal with this major issue

The manual transfer of files between Deck and windows PC is so tedious it would take any enjoyment out of the game to manually trade the save files I want using a service like WinpinatorWarpinator an absolute nightmare and until they add the option to choose which saves you want to sync with the cloud steam cloud is completely unusable even at current stages it is taking 30 mins to sync after closing the game and will get even worse the more playtime I put in

If this issue is fixed this review will immediately go to a 100 positive I just have no clue in the world how that sort of major issue would ever make it past QAtechnical review",neg
1086940,I really want to give it a recommendation but some fights even at Explorer difficulty is starting to get overwhelming for me especially the ones where you get outnumbered obviously I might have skill issue as well but so far the game is just partly enjoyable for me,neg
1086940,"h1 TLDR  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL CAMERA HEIGHT CONTROLS ARE IMPLEMENTED h1

This is a grand shame because there is much for which I can recommend this game It is likely the greatest digital Dungeons and Dragons experience to date

There is however a MAJOR issue that has forced me to stop playing because it is so infuriating so joycrushingly annoying that it prevents me from having any fun at all

b YOU CANNOT MOVE THE CAMERA VERTICALLY AT ALL THIS ISSUE WAS FLAGGED IN 2020 DURING THE EARLY ACCESS b

If the reason that this is an issue is lost on you let me give you a couple of examples

First my party was in a cave which was winding upwards and I wished to sneak ahead with the party rogue so I needed to position the camera to get a good look at everything as I moved him up slowly While zooming out with the scroll wheel which is one of the only ways to i potentially i see what might be more than 5 feet above your characters heads I was suddenly shown the roof of the cave on which were some gnolls fighting some stuck humans characters I had not yet encountered and yet was forced to see because the game cannot understand and has no system or controls for changing the terrain level you wish to see and interact with when you press a button

Secondly the party was once again being stealthy in some very high rafters and one member of the party made a check to notice something down below Where was it What exactly are they looking at Should I be worried I HAVE NO IDEA I CANT LOOK DOWN This is made all the more infuriating when I can stand my characters at the edge of the rafters knowing full well that if I were stood next to them I could see so much more than I can from my floating POV It is RIDICULOUS that there is no camera height control and it must be implemented by Larian NOW",neg
1086940,I dont know what stupid little thing to click to advance the fucking game over and over im tired of googling this nonintuitive shit,neg
1086940,"Definitely a mixed bag with this one One the one hand its an excellent game love the story so far Everything plays well Feels a lot more like Divinity 2 than the old DD games but thats neither here nor there

On the other hand the hardest difficulty is not balanced Some fights I get through completely unscathed others feel just right and then some mechanics show up maybe only one time and without prior knowledge completely murder the entire party in the first turn and they had initiative so I guess Ill just sit there and die A lot of combats are supposed to start with perception nature or survival checks but the distance between check and ambush is often shorter than the distance between two party members walking I dislike that the most effective way to explore is literally 1cm at a time or saving every 10 seconds

Its definitely a game meant to be save scummed and sometimes that doesnt feel pleasant The most egregious example was during a conversation and lets say that this entity Im conversing with is very powerful Out of 3 conversation options 2 can lead to instant unavoidable party wipe by the way the autosave for the area was an hour back One just kills you and another kills you if you fail the saving throw Didnt appreciate that at all how the whole climactic event was handled and having to replay the combat portion

And finally the crashing is ridiculous The first day I crashed multiple times in character creation Theres a few zones where I crashed several times in the span of an hour and a few more random ones littered throughout the game Some of these crashes my GPU 7900xtx gives me an error and I can close the game Others I have to power down my PC And a few regular crashes that sends a report to Larian and all that 

This game released a bit earlier than expected so as to not compete with Starfield and I respect that decision but a month of bug fixing might have been a welcome addition

Maybe wait for the console release before you buy Cant recommend with the severity of the technical issues Im having Game is great would recommend otherwise",neg
1086940,Seems like it could be fun Way too much going on and the camera system blows I want to play but the camera movements just make it unenjoyable,neg

1172470,"I love this game solo q is rough if youre trying to rank up but the movement of Respawns games have always been amazing 

I cannot recommend this game to new players Even with the addition of the intro lobbies that are supposed to be new user friendly ie filled with bots as soon as youre out of it you will get stomped by high ranking preds and master ranked players regardless of the game mode The learning curve is steep and the community makes it steeper Smurfing is rampant and always will be and even if it werent an issue matchmaking will always put you in lobbies with someone whos macros and soft aim bot make them impossible to hit while theyre zeroed in on your forehead or predator ranked players

1172470,Apex Legends is a disappointing game that fails to live up to the hype The graphics are bland and uninspired the controls are clunky and unresponsive and the gameplay is repetitive and boring The selection of weapons and characters is limited and the matchmaking system is unreliable frequently matching players with people who are much higher or lower level than they are The ingame microtransactions are also a major problem as players are constantly bombarded with ads for new skins weapons and other cosmetic items Overall I wouldnt recommend Apex Legends to anyone looking for a fun and engaging multiplayer experience,neg

1172470,Respawn is not the same company that made Titanfall 2 anymore This is published by EA so you know theres no real progression unless you spend ungodly amounts of money for skins that dont look good You would think for a game with such good movement EA would realize how good this game could be Unfortunately the pros in this game arent good enough to move to another game and any new players immediately leave because this game also lags like crazy There is literally no reason to play this game I have played it since launch and its not like its gotten a 20 or health update to the game Im begging you please just dont play this game But if you do add me I guess,neg

1895880,Great game but only took 18 hours for 100 HD remake of the classics next,pos
1895880,"I definitely enjoyed the game however a few things were a bit of a let down 
The music well I could barely tell there was any background music half the time It definitely didnt feel atmospheric nowhere near to the level of the first 3 games Although its been a while since Ive played TOD etc so unsure how it compares to other more modern titles Similar thing with the bolts when being collected 

The graphics gun play and story line were all very enjoyable
The main thing Im a bit sad about was the lack of replayability In previous games there was more difficult achievements which enabled you to replay the game and it felt like not quite a new game but it was very engaging and there was a lot more to accomplish This game is quite quick to 100

I would still recommend the game especially since the first hotfix 
I look forward to future RC games on PC hopefully",pos

1895880,"What a game
Ratchet  Clank Rift Apart is the pinnacle of Action Adventure game design The entire game is packed with well designed and delivered content with no tedious fillup stages just to stretch length of the game so many games do this these days
Last time I praise a game to be pinnacle was a game of 90s That tells something

Before you buy
Ratchet  Clank Rift Apart is an Action Adventure game not a RPG game so dont expect player choices on characters or player influence on story development I have to point it out in my review because lots of people mix these two genres up",pos
1895880,"I have played and completed all Ratchet and clank games including the psp version of Ratchet and Clank Size Matters Ratchet and clank rift apart is the only reason why I wanted to buy ps5 But it looks like I will stay with ps4 pro and pc

1895880,"Awesome entry in the RaC series They took everything from the RaC1 remake that i liked and put it in this game 
Movement feels amazing and the weapons have the right balancing The story is a little on the lower side since they started to pander towards a broader fanbase movieRaC1 remake Hope they take their time and release more of these games good 20 hours of fun",pos
1895880,"ive been a long time R and C player played all 100 completion the of the PS2 games This one is almost just as good as those Theres a couple traversal parts that were kind of odd and took a couple tries and some early game battles where ammo seemed pretty scarce

problems some chunking and pauses for loading and a few random crashes while playing Im playing on a pretty beefy system too  Ryzen 9 3090Ti 64gb ram so im well within the performance spec except im playing it off of a platter HD instead of an SSD

noticed 1 UI issues in regards to the weapons they mention half trigger and full trigger pulls but that doesnt seem to be in effect on the PC version but instead half trigger is when you are aiming with the left trigger and shooting and full trigger is when you just shooting from the hip",pos

1895880,"This game feels like the old PS2 titles and if thats not enough to sell you i dont know what is Overall a great addition to the series

 They added a few new mechanics to modernize the game but it doesnt feel bloated with features or collectibles Its not a very long game but it is a fun romp around the galaxy with witty sarcastic commentary just like all the other Ratchet and Clank games 

My only complaint is that using crystals to change dimensions is a cool addition but the long load times do take away from the pacing of the game Although thats probably just my PC being a bit old lol

Edit I havent experienced any crashes yet but the framerate does dip in some of the more action packed moments",pos
1895880,ratcher and clonk,pos
1895880,"I would like to first state that I had this game running nearly perfectly  Ive seen and heard people struggle to even run this game but I had no issues whatsoever on that part  I feel bad for those people since this game was amazing

As a second note I wanted to talk about the Steam Deck  I have a steam deck but I played this game on my main rig the whole way through  I tried to play it on my Deck but that was a horrible idea  Regardless of it being completely verified I couldnt get this game to run higher than 20fps  No matter the settings I put on it wouldnt go higher than 20  Thats insane and it shouldnt be verified to run at all if this is the problem  If you only have a Steam Deck steer clear of this one

This game ran nearly flawlessly for me  It crashed once in my entire playtime but I also had quite a few bugs that prevented me from progressing certain areas  Occasionally cutscenes wouldnt trigger when I got to waypoints so Id have to reload the area and redo everything  I had that bug in the pocket dimension that made me lose like 3 hours of progress  That was awful

But for the actual game itself  It was probably the best out of the Future saga games  For me the Future Saga of games never quite hit quite as hard as the first 4 four Ratchet and Clank games  This is the best one since those original four games in my opinion  The weapon loadout is pretty good and interesting  Some weapons are way better than others but there was only a few I straight up barely used  The new Ryno was kinda lame tho  I look for giant missiles or nuclear explosions and this Ryno just makes stuff fall on enemies and its relevant to this game but not what I think of when I think of the Ryno

The story was good nothing to really write home about  But I was interested the whole way and some of the haha funny jokes were good too  Unless I missed it this is the first Future game that doesnt end with like a hint as to what the next game will be like  Thats fine tho  It took so many years for this one to come out anyway

I think I rambled enough on this  Id highly recommend being cautious if you pick this up to make sure itll even run on your system at all  Theres a few bugs throughout the game so Id recommend having a good amount of manual saves just in case you get soft locked  Id give this game like an 810  Its very fun enjoyable and looks incredible if you can get it to run properly  Just be wary of that if you plan to pick it up",pos

1895880,"I loved the PS2 trilogy of Ratchet and Clank so going into this I really wanted to like it but its just not happening Writing is insanely dull and boring and the worlds feel very cluttered and uninspired The actual combat feels good but it just isnt enough to keep my attention

Overall a pretty disappointing experience",neg
1895880,i cant even lode the game i cant play the tutorel if your reding this sony f you,neg
1895880,CRASH CRASH CRASH ALL IT DOES IS CRASH RTX 3090 13700K 64 GB OF DDR5 I CAN PLAY ANYTHING I WANT AT 2K ULTRA THIS GAME JUST CRASHES EVEN ON LOW,neg
1895880,"Waited a long time to play another RC and I enjoy this game but it has crashed on me consistently Some times it crashes 3 times in 10 minutes and other times ill got 34 hours without a stutter 
It is a good game and if they fix the crashing i would rate it a 910
All things considered i give it a 710 I will change this as they make fixes
I dont want to say not to play it but until that is fixed i cant recommend",neg
1895880,Its a really fun game but it crashes WAY TOO much,neg
1895880,this is impossible to play crashes to descktop without an error and noting helps to fix the situation refound,neg
1895880,had refund gameeis not ok 4 steamdeck first fallinh throgh floors and crashes the deck every 3min so sad steam sAys they tested it bs,neg
1895880,I have top of the line hardware and still experience approximately 24 fps with significant micro stutter Im honestly fine with a game like this getting  30 fps The occasional 3 seconds of micro stutter combined with hitting 9 fps make this game unplayable,neg
1895880,The game isnt bad but it doesnt feel worth the 60 its pretty buggy and there just isnt much to do in the worlds A bunch of it feel like filler The game isnt bad by any means just feels over priced but the core mechanics are decent and the graphics are good,neg
1895880,Infinite loading screen Cant play,neg
1895880,This game sadly receives a down vote from me and Ill explain why In the technical sense RCRA is a sound game visually stunning and playable But thats all its got going The gimmick of rift hopping is merely a means of set piece transition using the rifts to cleverly hide loading the next sandboxlevel area or to teleport the player character from one spot to the next There is nothing here that hasnt already been done in other games eg Portal On the note of being done before is well everything else This game I feel is just a reskin of its predecessor Ratchet  Clank 2016 for the Playstation 4 but soulless Instead of giving the player a fun memorable game Insomniac opted to throw their last release into the ESG diversity  inclusion grinder and out spat Ratchet  Clank Rift Apart Wonderful childish humor is replaced by boring politically correct pseudohumor check The male protagonist now made an incompetent mockery and overshadowed by a more capable female protag check Misandry emphasized oneliners and overarching gynocentrism check Developers Freudian slip of prejudice from said female protag toward another race ie robots check Making Ms Zurkon a mis and not a misses as to not offend feminist empowerment check Making Mr Zurkon a betamale pacifist check And yes I know theyre alternate versions of these characters but we all know thats just a cop out to cover up their actual intent for the ESG score  Lastly the reskinning and renaming of the most problematic of the ingame weapons to something more bland and pc check At the end of the day its as if this game were just another overwritten propaganda tool of the ESG assembly line and thats why I cant recommend this What I DO recommend if you must play a Ratchet  Clank game play the PS4 2016 RC because its pretty much this game only BETTER If it werent for the ESG diversityinclusion feminismgynocentrism and blatant reskinning of the better 2016 RC it would get a thumbs up from me,neg
1895880,Fun gameplay decent story but several bugs make it impossible to gain 100 completion and use of all the collectibles and the devs have no plan on patching these cause theyve been around since launch on the PS5,neg
1895880,This is just so sad I love the old Ratched  Clank series and this game would be a perfect addition to that but BUT the game is so fucking poorly optimized that it crashes randomly without any reason Ive tried low potato settings mid tier setting and high and even on pretty high settings the game runs well but random crashes 9 crashes in a hour and i will play this when a patch comes or something,neg
1895880,really fun game but it just keeps crashing,neg
1895880,Barely started the game and it keeps crashing Based on recommended specs my PC should handle the game its poorly optimized for PC,neg
1895880,Cant play the game sadly I got an infinite loading screen when i start the game tried everything to fix the issue and nothing helps would love some suggestions,neg
1895880,Game keeps crashing to the desktop in battle boss fights Very frustrating,neg
1895880,game has serious performance issues especially on nvidia cards based on the research ive done I should be able to run this on high at a capped 60fps I have a MUCH MUCH MUCH more powerful machine than a ps5 as soon as i fire any weapon the frame rate tanks Also what maniac said this game is ok for steam deck for god sakes the intro doesnt even play right there are times where ratchet gets sucked into a rift and hes floating in air making weird groaning noises for a solid minute or two before the next area loads Rift apart on its own when I played it on ps5 is a FANTASTIC experience But this port is bad same can be said about spiderman remastered since its the same porting team Just changing a single graphic setting tanks the framerate until you restart even if you are LOWERING the setting The studio makes millions theres no excuse for this level of incompetence for 60 dollars,neg
1895880,"First let me state I have been playing RnC since the OG and have made an effort to play every single one since and I havent been disappointed 

This game unfortunately does It has the feel of a RnC game it looks pretty and the controls are good Its missing a lot of substance that the other games do Why are the planets so short why is there so little arena stuff where it the extra mini games The whole game side and main content feels like a 13 or 12 of a real RnC game 

For the first time I never felt the desire to complete it in challenge mode the RYNO felt mid and it doesnt grab me like many of the old ones did 

TLDR Buy this game on sale its fun but incomplete",neg
1895880,"I had read the other reviews and made it a point to manually save regularly  which was a good thing  One time I was playing and when I hopped back in the ship the game froze and crashed  The associated autosave would no longer load  Luckily I had a manual save from 7 minutes before that would load  I then flew to another planet where Ratchet had to visit temples  After I had finished the one with Glitch I popped back into the main world underneath the mesh with no way of escaping  

Unfortunately Ive owned it for too long to refund it  Dont make the same mistake  Stay away until it becomes an acceptable game",neg

1938090,I love the campaign I wish instead of buying another whole 60 game to complete it since we were left off a cliffhanger they would just update it with new parts Expensive game rarely goes on sale No negative experiences so far Little to nobody talks idk how those tik tokers always get bad experiences when i get literally none Graphics are the best ive seen felt like i was watching a movie Allthough your paying for a cliff hanger with the campaign it keeps you busy and there are i think 57 gamemodes for it so you can just play it over again Still very disappointing with the sudden end in the story and having to pay just to experience the other parts Prob the best COD game with the graphics Came from Black Ops 3 and happy with the upgrade But they barely explain what to do if your new how to get skins how to select different game modes ect Overall good game worth the price defo get it on sale tho 70 too 35 You get a game and a movie,pos

1938090,Class Game,pos
1938090,I liked MW19 especially the multiplayer but the campaign is the biggest thing I bought this game and MW19 for  I liked the campaign in MW19 and MW22 takes everything 19 did and does it better  They really fleshed out the older characters like Ghost and Soap and brought in some new players like Graves and made them feel likeable and real  I was genuinely sad this game ended but Im so ready for MWIII  Multiplayer in this is just as good as MW19 movement is definitely a bit slower but it makes up for it with versatility and gunplay  The leveling system is a bit jank but it provides a goal for players to attempt to reach and keeps people playing  If youre a hardcore CoD fan theres a 5050 chance youll like this game  If youre a complete newbie to the Call of Duty franchise this one makes for a perfect first game,pos

1938090,worst game ive ever bought the servers suck game is full of glitches and half the time it dont even start and when they patch a glitch they fix it in some dumb way that makes the game more bad they just recently fixed a camo glitch and now you cant even save any gun with a camo on it it takes it off then make you save it blank and dont even get me started on the sbmm you can go 5 games in a row dieing then get two games in a row going slightly positive and then you get put with full on sweats that kill you over and over that you cant do nothing about and the campers they will ether be in a corner with a rpg or just holding one angle with a broken ar and the melee its like aimbot in your hands the tonfa if you get hit once it stuns you and makes you look into the sky even if you get first hits your dead its dumb how it locks onto you even if there not looking at you it will still lock onto you and kill you NERF THE MELEE speaking of nerf they nerf all the guns that are not relevant and keep the guns that have been meta for the past 4 seasons i played the beta and it was 100 times better 60 billion dollar company cant even make a good fun game and the prices for the packs things that used to be 500 cp is now 1500  you can obviously tell that they did it for the money made the game 70 dollars you pay 70 dollars for trash DONT BUY THIS GAME IT IS NOT FUN,neg

1938090,i fucking hate it here,neg
1938090,"Ive played this franchise for years Unfortunately no one else does an FPS with central mechanics as solid as call of duty Gun feel speed of combat etc If I found one Id play it

However every single other factor in this game detracts from that core quality The marketing and purchase pricepoints are predatory The art direction and therefore immersion has been completely ruined by adding ugly styleandthemebreaking cosmetics The matchmaking is manipulative and actively removes player agency The UI is horrible the structure of progression is boring and psychotic in a way only a massive corporation trying to squeeze more playtime out of you can make it The community aspect which was always somewhat toxic has been systematically dismantled 

The game aspect of this series survives by the grace of god Only while it is still profitable to hang a store off of a skeleton of a good game will any semblance of enjoyable gunplay persist into the future of this series Its already being eroded 

Dont buy this game I only play it because I need to turn my brain off and run in circles holding right trigger sometimes",neg
1938090,The game itself is solid But I cant recommend it with the companys anticheat and reporting systems In a previous game by the same developers I got hit with a ban for unauthorized software with no explanation of what it even was Shadow bans are also rampant where a weeklong timeout or longer can result from something as simple as annoying the wrong team Until they sort this out its not worth the risk if youre a PC player,neg
1938090,this game is really stupid in warzone 1 i bought snoop dog for 20 bucks and your saying i have to spend 20 more dollars for him again plus the game 70 dollars for mw2 and its a rigged story cant even beat it on realism with out getting sniped from across the map with ak47s how realistic just get warzone 2 mw2 isnt worth it even advanced warfare is better some could even infinite warfare is better,neg
1938090,NEW YEAR NEW GAME Quit with the yearly releases its awful,neg
1938090,Modern Warfare 3 made by a completely different and worse developer in less than a year and its going to be full price Yeah no,neg
1938090,Shit game dont buy it This game constantly runs at less than 60 fps even when my gpu and my cpu are at less than 70 load I constantly experience rubberbanding and stutters even tho my internet is good and this doest happen in any other games The game also not very fun because of the grind for weapons and the constant pushing for you to spend money on a 70 game Activison is a giant company and this kind of not optimized game with shitty servers is unacceptable for this price,neg
230410,"Ive been playing Warframe since Gauss update which is around 2019 or so Awesome fast paced looter shooter game

I dont usually play third person shooter games with photorealistic design like these but this one is an exception The Warframe designs which are like bio mechas are amazing the gameplay is really fun and its not just about the guns it also have melees and warframes abilities which combines into unique builds You can also change your warframes functionalities like strength durations and range with mods and such The cinematic stories are phenomenal and I still praise them till this day The game also has a lot of game modes which we will also come to this later The game also has amazingly friendly comunity as well This game is FREE TO PLAY while having AAA game level of designs and you can grind premium currency ingame pretty easily

HOWEVER the game is quite grindy which is the least worst thing on the list
You want to play with new stuffs NOW but you have to wait 3 days for it to finish crafting which kills off the hype
Every content updates brings you new game modes which is another content island that has barely anything to do with the rest of the game with materials that once you have everything you can craft with that materials will with no doubt never want to have anything to do with that game mode ever again Although a lot of content updates adds a lot of refreshing new game modes and well contents they all feel so different that it feels like another game entirely Every time
The game also lacks a form of endgame content By that I dont mean sitting in Survival for 2 hours killing level 9999 foot soldiers By that I mean actual hard bosses Assassinate missions are a joke the bosses are forgettable save for Eidolons Orbs and Ropalolyst which are not available for majority of the player unless they grind really hard to unlock them not to mention actually be able to beat them Railjacks are fun for the first hour or so but its also another content island which you dont want to have anything to do with Asides from those Liches and Sisters hunts are actually quite fun challenging and memorable as a boss and does give some nice uses or Raijacks as their dramatic final confrontation The new Orowyrm in Duviri Paradox is also quite something too but wayy too easy
I stopped playing Warframe around The New War but its still fun enough to keep me coming back to the game occasionally because of the fun gameplay the mechanics deep under it keeps pushing me away and every updates with new game modes keep getting me dumbfounded of what is going on and what to do every time I return

TLDR very fun game with fun gameplay but once you look deeper you will see a mess behind the mechanics",pos

230410,"There are so many great games out there Games with well written plot characters thoroughly crafted world and fun engaging gameplay but noooo Ive chosen to play this game for 13k hours Dont make my mistakes  play something else




What you wanna see some explanation as to why Im not recommending this 
strikepiece of cake
strike game Alright Ill do my best to explain but first a tiny note if you are already playing Warframe and enjoying it  great keep playing 

At a first glance Warframe seemed to be fairly good and engaging game visually it looks fine gameplay is fastpaced and overall fun to play Huge solar map and seeming existence of story creates an illusion of a deep well made game But that doesnt last long and as soon as you dive deep into the game it reveals what it really all about repetitive boring meaningless grind spiced up with endless bugs lack of structure logic and creativity
Warframe has actually very little content to offer and whatever content is there is just shoved into players face with absolutely no explanation or guidance or preparation
With the exception of a few storymissions and Plains of Eidolon all locations are just a random pile of premade tiles glued together during loading Tiles are rooms and there are maybe a few dozens of them in each set As a consequence missions look alike on different planets to the point when its impossible to differentiate one from another Considering that there are over 200 missions and only four main tilesets one for every enemy faction with tiny variations for onplanet and inspace missions soon I got sick of seeing same surroundings again and again
Game modes cant boast of variety either there are basically again four of them  a few modifiers Um correction that is on paper there are fourchange in reality youd be hard pressed to find difference between them as they feel and play rather identical 
Adding insult to injury AI is extremely simplistic making enemies blindly run at the player in sometimes straight line Cloak and they would act like nothing happened and no tenno was there Its little to no fun or excitement dealing this such opponents Often I felt sorry for them however odd that sounds
Now imagine all mentioned above multiplied by hundred or thousand Sounds tempting isnt it Once all quests are completed and all planets are explored there is not much left to do either further level up your Mastery Rank or customize your warframe playable character and equipment to its max Leveling Mastery Rank up is simple level up gear such as weapons companions or warframes Process of acquiring an item and then leveling it up is mindlessly simple and requires player to do samesimilar mission over and over and over again until the goal is reached Some stuff can be bought for real money but process of leveling it up cant be skipped
And finally icing on this cake bugs Endless bugs Every new bigor small update brings bugs often game breaking A recent example Sanctuary Onslaught game essentially was crashing when host player disconnected  host migration was not working on release and devs fixed this issue almost a week later What QA team was doing before the release remains a mystery Assuming there is a quality assurance team employed at DE devs

At the end of the day Warframe can offer very simple stylish gameplay with no depth to it If you are looking for more than that this game would feels just as fun as grinding wooden blocks with a sandpaper  for short sessions andor with friends to keep distracted   an okay experience but playing it solo for a prolonged duration of time at once is just dreadful

PS My experience is based on playing with Prime Access which costs like new AAA game and cuts in half leveling and credits grind plus gives platinum and credits Cant imagine what its like to play the f2pway the first time around

PPS and I havent even touched atrocious boss fights forsaken Index and Archwing modes unbalanced rewards absolutely annoying radio transmissions amateur voice acting glitching matchmaking convenient trading with other players lack of creativity or imagination when it comes to new stuff confusing craftingmods etc There are a lot of things wrong and no hint on something getting right anytime soon  only more new stuff added making game more and more chaotic

credits  ingame free currency
platinum or plat  premium currency",neg
230410,Shit game people waste thair entire life on this game grinding forever and spending all thair money on stuipid fucking warframe skins that look like shit fuck this game it eats your soul,neg
230410,"Edit 7182020 Politics has infected everything  DE is in bed with Communist Enjoy helping China intern their own minorities while placating those who would take away your ability to make the very game you have spent your lives creating  

Warframe There was a point in my time with World of Warcraft that I just became bored the fantasy asthetic I yearned for  the scifi for space I took a chance and played Mass Effect long after it had been out and was gobsmacked How could I have missed this game I thought  It strached that itched But it was not enough I needed more I looked and looked until I found Totalbiscuts lets play of Warframe And that was it I had found my game 

For a free to play game it has one of the most fair models there is If you have the time play If you dont pay The point of game is to play It is your choice to use fauxmoney to by the ingame currency Orrrrrrrr you can just play the game 
And if you are of a mind to try to have some fun while you do it

Pros
Support and engagement It would be hard pressed to say that they people that develope Warframe Digital Extreme lack any passion for this game They are almost fanatical about it Which in and of itself is a pro and a con You forget where you started see only the bright future and very rarely fill in the cracks that develop along the way 

I may have put too much into the idea that a developer would truly heed the calls by the player base In the end they have to keep the lights on And while that must be put first without an ear to the people that are paying to keep the lights on a developer may find the dog didnt just bite but took the whole forearm off at the elbow  

Game play a nice blend of beatem up and shooter in 3rd person perspective I like to see myself in relationship to world around me 

Cons

Loot system I am a big advocate of diablo style loot systems Warframe could hands down benefit from this style system with a revamped crafting system 

Parthian sTHOughT
The push for end game lt was in this game that learned that end game is what people look for when they want a reason to stop playing a game That is really what endgame is It is our push to escape the gravity of something that we have invested such a large amount of time in that we want that period at the end of the sentance The high note the touchdown grand slam the buzzer beater  

Well what if the game had no end What if we just played How about we have more game 

More game less endgame",neg
230410,"If I were to describe this game in one word it would be Repetitive

Devs for some reason decided a while ago to start removing anything that was fun and not grindy so no I cant recommend this game to anyone
There are a ton of max lvl players or lvl 18 who sit around doing nothing no matter what and the chat made for playing with other people always hosts negative or players who have no interest in new players no matter what

If you love grinding no dont get this game because unless youre interested in using tricks or bugs to solo any of the endless modes you wont be doing anything past quick endless missions and thats the same as wasting a so called key for the higher maps though you can also play the normal maps for no real loot besides resources that youll be using for crafting weapons and such 
There are of course other things to do like spend hours upon hours of grinding for rare items to sell for premium currency so you can join the fashionframe spending all your money on cosmetics so you can look cool like everyone else

Is there anything redeeming Not anymore no anything that has been added has been kicked down into the dirt due to DE also known as the devs of this game for some reason thinking it was either overpowered too easy or a third reason which makes even less sense

AFK Farming Impliment a broken AFK timer that completely nullifies any and all regen on your character until you press your dodge key

A certain build requires very specific attributes to work but it makes you invincible and isnt fun to use all the time Dont worry DEs got you covered completely change the characters abilities and attribute bonuses thatll make everyone happy right

An ability can be upgraded to pull mob drops to you but still makes you build in a very specific way Make the upgrade only affect the user surely thatl lbe a good change no one will dislike it

Im making it sound like it only affected characters but even the weapons in the game suffer and they suffer way too hard than you can possibly think some weapons are just so insanely overpowered some for a while some have kept their spot for years only beaten by newer versions of that weapon and with this some weapons are instantly thrown out of the window when some weapons hit the community even with upgraded versions of the weapon the old ones are most likely thrown out on the spot

Sure you can use any weapon you like no one has the right to tell you to not use something just because another weapon is better but if you arent doing the damage you need to and you want to play a tiny bit serious youll have to follow everyone else using the strong weapons and say goodbye to your cool or less popular weapons no exceptions 

The list goes on to things that make even less sense and even things that didnt make anything easy or stupid were changed because of DEs stupidity
Its surprising this game isnt dead already if you were here from the start and still play I feel very sorry for you


Edit I forgot to mention another big thing that completely ruined the game when I was talking about builds multiple characters or frames  warframes have been completely changed in how stats affect their abilities meaning if you had a build from long ago that needed one set of mods theres a big chance all those hours and items spent on getting the perfect build together will be completely wasted and youll more or less have to do it all over Never any compensation or at least a warning Im over 100 sure Im not the only one that had to reforma a few frames or discard it completely because of it Sure some playstyles or builds will always be good at one point and fall off or become much less effective at some point but this was almost completely opposite of what you normally would use on certain characters before Then theres the problem with mod points either pay 20 premium currency for double mod points to upgrade your character with or save it for the prime version of the warframe which will come but might first come far in the future leaving people with less time and money hanging around with characters unsuited for missions behind because theyre saving that upgrade for the prime version Who by the way will always have some type of upgrade either better or easier ways of modding correctly or having better survivability",neg

671860,very addicting,pos
671860,good game,pos
671860,Nothing more enjoyable than role playing as a medic and helping grown men from crying on the floor because they died to a grenande,pos
671860,This is one of the games ever,pos
671860,"I was seriously not expecting it to be THIS much fun
Visuals may be not be the sharpest but they went all in when it comes to the gunplay and the animations Also 254 players is absolute MADNESS and I love it",pos
671860,Reminds me of the days when I got home from middle school turned on the Xbox 360 and played BF3 all night long with my friends 1010 properly combines modern features nostalgic game modes and basic yet fun graphics,pos
671860,3 dudes beat EA at their own game,pos

671860,turn on vc,pos
671860,better than bf2042,pos
671860,Of all the games ive playedthis is certainly one of them,pos
671860,yes,pos
671860,Incredibly fun and brings me back to early Battlefield with friends,pos
671860,"I dont get all the praise this game gets because its not really that good of a game
Its only fun with friends which every single game ever pretty much is that has multiplayer
The game is very unbalanced and youll only ever die to about the 3 same things ever with some vehicles being extremly under powered and some being borderline broken",neg
671860,If you like to cheat this is probably the game for you It has Easy AntiCheat but not sure why it says anti,neg
671860,i loved this game but now i cant create a clan till i prestige which will take a very long time to do i dont have a lot of time nowadays wished they would change this back,neg
671860,If youre familiar with the Battlefield games that inspired this one youll find that this game is a massive downgrade in comparison,neg
671860,Was a cool game until I saw what contact with the team is like I wouldnt trust those dudes with used onions,neg
671860,Fun game Very well done since its made by only 3 people That being said IMO the game is not in a good spot ATM Guns are unbalanced a little to much for my taste Everyone seems to use 3 guns and thats about it Some of the maps are not fun to play on for me The Support class has 4 guns to play with while every other class has access to what seems like every gun in the game CTF was an amazing addition to the game Hope more stuff like that and gun balances keep coming Will give the game another shit in a patch or two and will change my review then if needed,neg
671860,Another great game with lots of potential ruined by rampant cheaters and bs damage mismatch Youll pump people full of bullets only to get one shotted over and over again It has a spectator mode where you can watch players sprint around the map 3x faster than anyone else one shotting everyone they come into contact with Not worth the time or money,neg
671860,will change to positive once wakistan and wineparadise are removed from the game,neg
671860,Game caters too much to competitive losers,neg
671860,It runs like shit after update 20,neg
671860,Over run with hacks like any other FPS but they DOVE REALLY HARD INTO COPYING ACTIVISON WITH ALLOWING SPAWN CAMPING Add in you that you also cant spawn on your team 12 the time when not in a fight but they allow spawning as bullets are flying Was a fun novel concept before they started the first patch and then the game went south fast Not worth the time or effort any more FS after the 20 patch,neg
671860,Shady business practices devs record in game comms you can opt out but if you do you cant use them not worth,neg
671860,Game is full of cheaters they keep trying to solve the problem but its just unplayable,neg
671860,Its just not that interesting ,neg
671860,version 2 screwed with the movement too much,neg
671860,"I hate to admit it but the game just isnt what I wanted it to be 
My PTR review was glowing which is probably because I could only play it once a week for a couple hours at a time  Since the games release Ive been able to play it more often for longer amounts of time and Ive noticed some things
The playerbase is in absolute delusion 
Yes I know there are only 3 devs Yes I know what theyve done is impressive consider the workload and all of that however this is an absolutely idiotic choice on behalf of the devs There is no reason why they need to overload themselves with work however theyre probably going to stay that way because of the playerbase
This game has been so over hyped by content creators general players and just the internet  in general that its left so many people seemingly blind to the fact that this game just isnt good 
The game is in no way bad by any means its just not good but since the community is practically on their knees blowing the devs and refusing to stop its left this weird stain on the game where you feel like you are forced to like it Just because the new CODs suck doesnt mean this is any better

All I am saying is that this game should be Battlebit remastered Not the CoD killer
People really just need to look at this game from an objective and unbiased standpoint and until they do this game is going absolutely nowhere",neg
671860,polygon forever  and its free to play too,neg
671860,its fun to play if there is no cheaters the cheaters killed it,neg
