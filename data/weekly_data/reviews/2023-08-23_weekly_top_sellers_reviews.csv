1086940,"Very MINOR spoiler included after this paragraph the short version is  its fun and over all worth it however expect some absolutely random as hell bugs that range from NPCparty character voices changing suddenly to whole cut scene malfunctioning


Anyway
There are SEVERAL bugs that are more than a little annoying  from the camera getting stuck at random to entire scenes being so bugged that the game skips it rather than showing it ie the leader of the goblins is trying to cast speak with dead on a dead mind flayer  the mind flayer is invisible for no reason but only while in the conversation  the introductory part of the conversation goes fine but as soon as they would have started the ritual it just cuts and theyre sitting in their throne chair just chilling

As this is truly supposed to be an open RPG game I consider that game breaking I can deal with having to fix the camera when it teleports itself into the ceiling or wall and gets stuck I can deal with NPC voices changing at absolutely random sometimes hilarious moments and I can even deal with how absolutely terrible some of the quests are at explainingoutlining what the hell it is you are supposed to dorandomly not being able to role play in a Role Play Game is a huuuge bummer And yes I tried sacrificing an hour of progress only for the same glitch to be there Very disappointing

But again I still think its a good game over all  especially if you can get it on sale  I just wish it wasnt buggy as hell",pos

1086940,Obsessed Basically all the same rules as DD but in the form of an interactive narrativeheavy chooseyourownadventure turnbased tactical video game Having way too much fun to the point of considering getting out of plans to just stay home and keep playing Beware getting sucked in,pos
1086940,Best RPG of the decade,pos
1086940,"So I broke down and bought Baldurs Gate III The Baldurs Gate series is still one of my very favorite series ever I was hesitant to buy it because I was afraid theyd screw up something I loved so much 
Observations after not even 2 hours of play
1 This is a PHENOMENAL game Incredibly polished detailed the plot hooks you in right away Its a faithful translation of DND5e to a video game It totally deserves all of the accolades its getting 
2  it doesnt feel like Baldurs Gate to me This is Divinity Original Sin DND Forgotten Realms Edition Maybe Ill change my mind after playing more but it just doesnt feel the same The closest modern games to the feel of Baldurs Gate for me were the Pillars of Eternity games by Obsidian 
Take that for what its worth folks Im not disappointed I bought it",pos
1086940,Very enjoyable for DD enthusiasts  Clever incorporation of many of the mechanics of fifth edition rules  Incredibly varied story lines depending on the choices you as a player make AND the rolls of the dice  Very fun with great replayability,pos
1086940,Amazing game,pos

1086940,Game breaking bug 3 hours into first act with the threatening children Teifling guards crap Would have to waste hours of playtime at this point Not the only buggy things Ive seen but definitely the worst Theyve had years to fix this What the hell were they doing,neg
1086940,more like league of legends than dnd,neg
1086940,"This game is amazing graphically and has so much content and lots of replay value and the devs have put a lot of work in this game There are still many bugs I have heard though I havent come across any but to me this game was too difficult I played Baldurs Gate 1 and 2 and loved it If you expect Baldurs Gate 3 to be similar you will be disappointed In Baldurs Gate 1 and 2 if your party died you reloaded and tried again hoping for better dice rolls and it didnt cheat which I feel this game did eg In proper DD advantage is to roll 2 x d20 and choose the higher one but I dont know how it worked in this game because in the combat log the amount of times I scored 2 3 or 4 was unbelievable I have to admit the enemy missed a fair amount too If you enjoyed DOS 2 you may enjoy this as I think Baldurs Gate 3 should have been called DOS 3

In Act 1 everything seemed equal but towards the end of Act 2 the battles were 5 to 1 20 enemy to your 4 The only way to manage this was by having a high enough level I was level 6 and had no chance A player told me I should be level 9 by then so I reckon to be that you need to succeed in every side mission as well as main missions I know of one mission where at a certain point youve managed the mission fine but as i found out several hours after this I didnt which made the game harder

I feel this game should have given warnings about being too low a level at the point of no return parts and missions that look like you passed but didnt should be a fail or a warning that tells you the game may be harder if you carry on

I got this game when it was released in EA and was really looking forward for the full release I now wish I hadnt bothered I cannot get a refund so I will probably go back to it but use mods The devs have created this game to allow mods I have now uninstalled it",neg
1086940,"In its current form its Deus Ex with literally THREE endings You will play this game for 100 hours all for it to signify nothing I thought my game was buggedbut no trust me it just ends You will not be satisfied  

The last zone is a rushed cramped confusing mess Towards the end I stopped doing or searching for quests because it simply became overwhelming and tedious Youll do quests out of order and have characters youve never met be angry with youfor reasons you wont rememberbecause youre not guided at all just thrown into a cluttered sandbox

The more people play this game the more theyll realize its not game of the year Its a frontheavy tedious rushed product that aims for quantity over quality and achieves it",neg
1086940,Buggy Wait a year for bugs to be fixed then buy it at a discount,neg
1086940,It just me but i really hate the angles in the game,neg
1086940,Unfinished and buggy Do not buy at full price,neg
1086940,A really good game dont get me wrong But considering the game wont even run anymore and just continues to crash whenever I try to load a save itd probably be a good idea to wait a few months for Larian to patch out the more gamebreaking bugs before giving this game a try Because at this point its gotten kind of ridiculous Havent even gotten to finish Act 1 before the game broke No mods or anything mind you And verifying file integrity doesnt work half the time so be careful about that,neg
1086940,"This game is a masterwork of modern gaming the writing acting the story and most of the characters are all incredible and the devs should be commended for years for such an astounding accomplishment  

However this game is certainly not for everyone  Ive seen lots of forum posts that this game is too easy that it needs to be harder etc  This game is easy for people that know DD 5e  If you dont you will probably struggle  If you just want to play the game for the story youre going to struggle

Ive played 1000s of hours of Xcom starting with the very original Xcom games in the 90s  For as frustrating as Xcom can be Ive never felt that the combat is cheap  This game the combat feels cheap  It feels like the game is looking for a very specific set of tactics to be used and if you dont use those tactics you are punished  Now that may not be the caseoften times when Im failing I dont know why  The game doesnt tell you there is no combat log that shows the work so to speak  

Ive reached the point in this game where as much as I love the story and characters I cant play the game  I feel like the game is just going to screw me over at every opportunity  I go into combat and expect to lose to the cheap cheaty combat system sorry having a character get 6 critical misses in a row is not likely and it is not fun  And no there were no debuffs or curses on my character and no buffs on the enemies I was shooting at  I expect hours of reloads to accomplish something  I made it to act 3 and Im stuck there are so many things to do I dont know what I should be doing where I should be going or who I should be talking to  Keep in mind that the only way I made it to act 3 at all is by modding the max level so my party isnt murdered in 2 rounds

Overall this game is amazing  If you are a DD player you will love this game  If you are not I would strongly suggest you consider if watching youtube videos or streams of the game would be better  I definitely would not buy this game again nor would I recommend it to anyone that is not already a DD playerthis game is just not made for the averagecasual gamer in mind or someone that wants to play for the story or that just wants to feel like a powerful hero   If you dont understand the combat system the action economy and especially the magic system and dont have a desire to spend hours trying to learn itor even buying a 5e book to learn it which seems like what is probably necessary then I would leave this game on the shelf",neg
1086940,"The game is amazing one of if not THE best games I have played to this day I love the story love the characters and how interactive and free you can be in this game Honestly I havent played a game this good in a while now and BG3 is a welcome surprise but THE ENDING FOR KARLACH AS A COMPANION IS UTTER GARBAGE FOR REAL WHAT KIND OF FOCKERY IS THAT LARION KARLACH DESERVED BETTER THAN THAT THERE WERE MULTIPLE WAYS OF MAKING SURE HER ENDING WOULD BE BETTER BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO YALL HAD TO MAKE THE WORST ENDING FOR A COMPANION OUT OF THE MOST LOVABLE AND AMAZING OF THEM ALL 

Spoilers ahead



I warned you


IF I WANTED TO BE SAD AND DEPRESSIVE ABOUT SOMETHING I WOULD JUST CONTINUE LIVING MY LIFE THIS IS LITERALLY DND WHERE ALMOST EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE THERE WERE MULTIPLE OPTIONS TO SAVE HER AND YET THEY WENT WITH JUST LETTING HER BE IN HELL TILL THE DAY SHE DIES DYING BECAUSE NOTHING CAN BE DONE OR BECOME A MINDFLAYER AND LOSE HERSELF SLOWLY THANK YOU LARIAN FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL GAME BUT THIS ENDING WAS HORRIBLE",neg
1086940,"Act 1 is perfect act 2 is very good

Problem game falls apart entirely in last act so playing it will result in a very dissatisfying experience

Tons of content was cut

Will change this review should Larian Studios reinstate at least pathways to get proper endings for all companions

Dont buy currently Dont reward the content cuts with your money",neg
1086940,This game is horrible for someone who doesnt want to spend time reading a bookload of conversations Every detail in the game expands into way too many more details which simply are uninteresting for someone who just wants to play and slay after a long day You spend great part of the game time watching characters walk slowly In villages one wrong click induces theft which makes everyone hostile towards you and kills the party In the end its just a frustrating mix of way too many details way too much lore and too little action,neg
1086940,this game gave my pc aids no thank u,neg
1086940,If only they would fix the dozens of crashes this game experiences it would be  mostly perfect,neg
1086940,"While a lot of the game is fun the combat is so unbalanced and obnoxious that it hurts
From enemies that absolutely always go out of their way try to send you off of ledges not just shove they always throw you at least 10m whereas your own shove action barely even does 1m to Arrow of Roaring Thunder that throws you perpendicularly to how the arrow hit you allowing enemies to throw you off a ledge without even being in your general vicinity or even in the right direction
The game seems to be balanced around the idea that you can cheaply reanimate your party members and that makes it so damn annoying
It never feels like the game is punishing you for playing poorly Instead it just feels like youre meant to grind levels and retry the same combat encounter 37 times I get why thats the case you cant balance a video game with save files like you would balance a tabletop RPG A tough combat encounter in a TTRPG is one where you almost get TPKed A tough encounter in a video game is one you have to retry multiple times
Still its not fun to do that
On top of that you dont even get to play any of the interesting DnD races

Its not all bad though The writing is really good and the character interactions are great and rarely ever feel out of place The world and art direction are stunning and exploration is extremely fun Its just the combat thats infuriatingly annoying",neg
1086940,"The bugs present in this game make it unplayable trash  Sick and tired of so called AAA games not even being functional when they release There are numerous game altering bugs that require constant restart such as when your characters continually get stuck in dialogue mode in the middle of combat Another bug after many hours of play crept up in that the NPC that respecced my characters one day would do so and the next woudl not now somehow baked into the game across multiple saves but not all  I am just going to uninstall the game and try to get my money back or backcharge my credit card because I dont want to keep playing if there are now breaks and bugs baked into my game files

Sad and awful  I just want to play a game on PC out of the box and have it operate at a normal base functionality  Give me shit graphics and zero soundtrack I dont care just make it playable  Larian should be ashamed of themselves for issues like this after the ridiculous budget and beta period they had

Avoid this unplayable dysfunctional trash game",neg
1086940,The game ran fine for 72 hours though act 3 had some performance issues  Now with hotfix 4 I had three crashes in act 3 within a few minutes As of now the game is therefore unplayable I guess thats what you get for only having act 1 in early access Just wait a few patches until the masses have beta tested the entire game,neg
1086940,"For me I would not likely recommend the game currently I know the reviews are outstanding for it thats fine and when it works its great However there are lots of issues Gamepadcontroller support comes and goes Some days Im able to use it some days it refuses to recognize it Its a dice roll 

Besides this frame rate issues crashing all the normal stuff happens semi regularly Some days its great some days its not 

In all honesty Id likely wait 36 months before picking it up or grab it on a sale",neg

Bad things
The UI or any and all menus
The play tried to make offense worse but not you just have Defenders with speed boost that can fall trail a reciever and then catch up and no look int a ball in the air
Receivers always run into defenders and decide the play is over and will walk deciding that the play is over with the ball in the QB hand still 
That even with the multiplayer pay to win micro transactions and the extra 10 dollars EA will still decide to screw you instead of a fancy paid worker

1433140,"This game is great Super fun 3v4 asymmetrical horror But I cant recommend it in its current state due to how much bugs and server issues ruin the experience right now

Ive played 30 hours of this game which equates to about 80 or so matches as both sides The bugs and server issues in this game plague nearly every match This includes but is not limited to
 A bug where you cant invite others to your party via code because the invite code generated is too long for the input box so you cant play with friends that are crossplay the only way to invite others is through your platform like steam
 Being disconnected after a match before a match or while loading for invalid credentials This network error can pop up at almost any time and once it does you will not be able to use any online functionality of the game at all read play it at all until you restart it And once you do it will not be long before it happens again and you have to launch the game again
 Random crashes during matches Ive crashed on loading crashed while attacking a family member crashed while grappling with a victim crashed while shimmying through a gap you name it The game freezes crashes and say goodbye to your match It can also happen to one of your teammates resulting in a very lopsided game at times
 No XP gain A huge part of this game is leveling up skills and attributes through a skill tree which requires you to level up by playing the game But right now theres a good chance that the EXP you earn is never credited to your account Its very frustrating to play a good match see 2305 XP only to watch as you hit next and the XP numbers jump back down invalidating all your work for that game
 Server issues Although rarer than most of the other issues Ive mentioned in 5 of my 80 games the server has shut down while playing meaning every single player lags out after several minutes of being unable to perform any action Very annoying
 Rubberbanding progress For some reason actions like picking locks and searching chests seem to be serversided or validated rather than client sided When combined with bad servers this creates a really bad experience where you can be halfway through a toolbox search or lockpick sequence only for your progress to jump back down or your E presses to not register This has killed me several times and feels super unfair
 Grandpa cutscene At a certain point in the game an unskippable cutscene will play that forces everyone to look at it meanwhile taking away full control of the game for several seconds and you cant see your character or surroundings As leatherface this can cause your chainsaw to overheat without you being able to do anything about it if you were revving the saw before the cutscene It can also interrupt your chases and you end up losing the person you were chasing and on the victim side has killed me when it played right as I was going for a sneak attack on leatherface

Give this game a few months and see if the developers have worked out all the bugs Maybe theyll put it on sale some time in the far future If these issues arent fixed or mitigated substantially I really cant recommend you play the game right now as these issues are rampant and really hurt the fun factor of the game",neg
1433140,"b Heres what you do b

u Connie u
Spam the interact key on any box bones or unhook
i If you play anyone else youre dead But also if you play Connie youre dead i

Let me explain

Other survivors stand no chance without Connie So if you play killer  focus out Connie especially if you doubletriple team her its a gg Every other survivor takes 38 minutes to acquire anything be it a bone a lockpick etc Connie 2 seconds So while Connie is indeed the only broken survivor if you focus her out its a gg for the rest of the game Also a gg if they dont pick Connie

Sissy seems pretty strong poison traversing gaps improved blood gathering etc People who cant traverse gaps should have improved blood gathering and people who can chase relatively well should have it slighly lessened
Connies everything speed should be 14th and other survivors slightly raised so you dont spend an entire minute or more on the bonelockbox mini game
The game is in no way teambased which I feel should be improved on Two people lock picking stabbing grandpa aura reading more etc
You shouldnt be able to die in 8 seconds in your spawn If you end up losing health enough to be killeddowned before any doors are unlocked in the basement you should restart somewhere else hung up only ONE time

The game seems extremely killer sided once you focus out Connie or she gets nerfed so I cant recommend ever playing as survivor This being antiteam focused for survivor solidifies this",neg

1433140,"It really is a fun game but it becomes so less and less the more you play from both me and my friends experiences alone and in a premade Like a youtuber I forget the name of said Play it while people are still dumb This cannot be more true as even a few days after release Im starting to see really frustrating and effective strats that get people out in mere minutes This usually just devolves down to someone distracting the hell out of Bubba while everyone rushes a generator or another escape and gets the hell out The first few days this game was out I played about 40 matches all as family and in those matches maybe 6 people max escaped Next few days it was 2 or 3 people nearly every match The power of premades is insane 

I played only victims for a few days and escaped most of my games within 5 minutes Seems people are starting to just rush actions as hard as possible to get things done quick and honestly it works most of the time The game play gets stale pretty quick even with friends but thats alright I really just see this as a casual game you can have a good 3060 hours of fun with with some friends The game itself is beautiful and its clear a lot of passion was put into the map design and character models 

I think its mostly going to suffer from the licencing it chose since so many of the characters and locations are part of movies that are going to be a pain to get rights to if they ever want to expand the content And as for content the game lacks There are a few beautifully recreated maps along with 5 family members and 5 victims As for things to grind for or even look forward to playing to earn theres nothing I would compare the skins to the equivalent of overwatch blue skins Which is fine you dont need anything flashy in a game like this but most of the family members dont have any cosmetics at all The only thing you play to earn is skill points to throw onto different characters So with all this and the player base getting smarter matches getting shorter probably a good thing and family getting more frustrating every day make your own conclusions on how long this game will last I dont think its a bad thing if this game doesnt last long its a fun casual game thats nice to kill some time on with some friends Dont optimize the fun out of the game with builds and strats just have fun

1353230,"This is coming from someone whos never played any JSR games The controls platforming tagging and exploration are great and pulling off long trick combos is satisfying The levels are big but not overly confusing and theres collectibles to find everywhere The soundtrack slaps pretty hard too However the combat is a bit lackluster especially when it comes to hit sounds The worst enemy is the standard cop with a pistol because they keep hitscan sniping you offscreen and they respawn infinitely

My biggest gripe is that the game does not explain one crucial core mechanic When youre on foot and press any trick button followed by jump you do the corkscrew jump This is the games high jump and also your most effective combat move It is required to reach some areas and to make combat flow more smoothly because it launches several enemies in the air where they can be tagged for an instant takedown The tutorials dont seem to cover this move or at least not in a way that I would have noticed I only learned about it from a Youtube video

Other than that the game is fun flows nicely and doesnt seem to have any gamebreaking bugs Would recommend",pos

1353230,"Bomb Rush Cyberfunk obviously draws instant comparisons to Jet Set Radio specifically Jet Set Radio Future which in my opinion is the better of the two JSR games Within an hour or so of playing this game I knew it was special In fact after my first playthrough I can say that in my opinion if we are going to class this as the unofficial third game in the series then it is the best JSR game so far by a long stretch

To begin the controls and gameplay are incredibly smooth there are more tricks than JSRF and instead of just using inline skates theres now two additional options which are the skateboard and the BMX All of these have there own unique tricks and animations and different areas of the map may require you to use a certain moveset to access them for example the BMX can open garage doors the inline skates can smash glass floors and the skateboard can spin on fire hydrants to access high up areas which gives you a reason to switch up what you are using adding variety to the gameplay

The movement allows for special boost tricks which allow you to close massive gaps in the air and chain ridiculous grinds together to achieve combos and high scores You can also hold the right trigger to manual or slide depending on what you are using which keeps your combos going while you are not on a rail however there is a time limit to how long a manual or slide will extend your combo for Another thing that differs from Jet Set Radio is the fact that you can now switch between being on foot or on skatesBMX mid combo by hitting the bumper allowing you to slide through vents on slippery surfaces or to slide downhill Sliding does not lose momentum as long as you are on certain surfaces allowing your combo to be held onto for a longer period of time You can also lean into corners which gives you a speedboost and increases your combo multiplier for each new corner you lean into Wallrunning can also be used in the same way as each new wall you run on raises your combo multiplier

The way the graffiti system works in the game is very user friendly as you do not have to switch between what graffiti you have equipped Instead when you go to paint a surface some dots will appear the larger the piece the more dots will appear All graffiti in the game can be accessed at any time you just need to connect the dots in the specific combination for the piece you want The graffiti combos can be accessed through the phone at any time which is a great quality of life addition in case you forgot how to do any of the graffiti This can be done on the fly without interrupting combos so it is more similar to JSRF than JSR where you had to stand in place to spray your graffiti However it still has the element of JSR where you had to move the sticks in order to manually spray the graffiti as opposed to JSRF where you just hold the trigger as you ride past a wall Essentially it merges the best parts of the graffiti systems of JSR and JSRF while adding modern quality of life improvements as well as a huge amount of graffiti to choose from

The soundtrack in this game is also phenomenal and is up there with JSR and JSRF Hideki Naganuma makes a return and 2Mello also makes an appearance on the soundtrack for the first time who fans will know for his musical output that has been inspired by the Jet Set Radio games

The graphics maintain the cartooncelshaded aesthetic from JSR and the environments here are absolutely gorgeous to look at especially on the bigger maps like Pyramid Island and Mataan where you can climb high and view large amounts of the map from above

The level design in the game is great as well as there are many graffiti spots and hidden items such as unique outfits songs and vehicle skins to be found that can take a fair amount of time to discover Some levels such as Brink Terminal and Mataan also draw clear inspiration from Jet Set Radio Future while expanding on the original concepts Brink Terminal is clearly based off of Shibuya Terminal and Mataan draws inspiration from The Skyscraper District and Pharaoh Park This is not to say that these levels are derivative or are a poor imitation of JSRF levels they are well crafted levels that pay a loving homage to the source material

1353230,Game carries the values of Jet Set Radio all the way through if you like Jet Set Radio or Jet Set Radio Future you will love this game the soundtrack is incredible the game play is addictive  satisfying and surprisingly the story hit the mark very well actually keeping my interest throughout the whole game took me just under 10 hours to beat the main story  I still have plenty of side content to explore My only personal gripes towards the game are the combo system the game play is quite simple while doing tricks you only have about 3 tricks in any possible state you can be in ie during Grinding Manual Midair in any of these states you can press circle square or triangle to do a basic trick Id like if there was some more depth to the combo system implementing maybe directional inputs with buttons presses for more trick variation because in its current state the combo system feels somewhat thoughtless where I mash those 3 buttons while doing the actual fun part which is moving around  holding momentum early in the game you get introduced to boost tricks tricks that you simply do while holding the boost button these tricks are when the game feels like it gets a bit of depth where you are able to hold boost  then use these boost tricks to gainretain momentum or make more distance on a jump that was previously unable to be made while these are great I feel like you can see how more things like the boost tricks would of helped the game a little bit more gameplay wise Hopefully if a sequel comes about they refine what they currently have because the game is incredibly fun  I think it can be even better,pos
1353230,"game fun story is interesting good vibes good music

1353230,"I am the target demographic for this game having played both Jet Grind Radio  JSRF I loved those games growing up and affectionately call this game nostalgiabait I followed their social media posts when I saw them and was generally excited for the game even buying it on day 1 to show my support for games like these

But I have been pretty disappointed by BRC and want to walk through why that is

The Police
When I was grooving to the sweet tunes of BRC and ended up beating up a cop on a whim it was never an interesting fight or a huge challenge but these games are not combatoriented so that is totally fine What is not fine is how it felt like whenever Id beat on a cop in my way a short cutscene would play and more cops with higher stakes weapons would appear So they are essentially telling me to either leave or hurry up with whatever my goal in the area is What this incentivizes you to do as a player is to not engage with the police which while thematic feels awful the times you forget and try to use the game systems to mess around and do what feels natural and cool Telling the players to not interact with the game world feels like a negative play pattern and I cant imagine why it was implemented how it is because it takes away from the awesome movement and tagging systems in place

The Length
I dont want this review to focus on game length too much but beating the game in 8 hours was definitely deflating I actually enjoyed the narrative that was told  it wasnt some masterpiece but it was fun and over the top in ways I wanted to see in a game like this And while I dont regret my purchase more on that later I would want more content in the tin for noncompletionists like myself Essentially I wanted to be in this world longer and see more twists and turns of the story as an excuse to stick around but the core gameplay couldnt substitute for that

The Levels
Almost everytime I loaded in a new area I was immediately taken in by how cool they all looked The mall Pyramid island But the issues slowly seeped in and are much more noticeable in the less inspired areas These places are large which is sweet but they feel much more empty than they should be The island is a good example where all the sweet wild grinding areas make you hype to get around but getting to those parts means playing around in a less than interesting and very spread out area that has few real places of interest and does not feel lived in or fun to explore Time and time again I would try to find my way up to a certain spot end up missing a step or two and land back at the bottom Once or twice I didnt mind but getting back up in certain areas just started to feel like a punishment and often those sweet areas werent even that great once i got there Also some levels like the bus station felt a little too close to JSRFJet Grind Radio levels

The Challenge
First I want to recognize that Team Reptile had a tough ask in front of them I recall one or two parts of JSRF being oddly difficult but the rest of the game being pretty reasonably easychill Saying that I still felt the game needed something more as the crew battles felt pretty formulaic by the endpoint To their credit I dont know of an ideal way to approach this end of things and frankly it might be the least of my critiques listed here Combos are laughbly easy to chain and pull off and while it was fun to do on my own for funsies it slowly got less and less exciting as it hard to be inventive with the limited moveset and all I had to do was find optimal parts of each level for multipliers which was not an exciting thing to keep in the back of my head

The Mechanics
Almost 80 of my way through the game I got a text from another character and they explained a new mechanic about holding right trigger as I jump off of a grind I have no idea why the game decided to wait this long to let me in on that but it definitely made me hopeful I was at most 50 through the game I dont love tutorialized mechanics but some more of that probably wouldnt have hurt

Okay those are my big gripes Its a lot I know but now I can get to the rest of this review The things I liked

The Music
Holy wowza the music in this game was fantastic I just want it on shuffle and then it might be perfect

The Style
They nailed everything I cared about visually too These characters looked so good and yes this is nostalgia speaking but I loved all of it The other gangs were awesome which is perfect because I loved all the wild gangs in the other games More wacky gangs please The graffiti looks amazing really sweet stuff and lots of amazing pieces to collect and tag

Tagging
I am a little more torn on this one but I think I really liked their tagging mechanics The pausing while grinding felt a little jarring depending on context but overall I love not worrying about spray cans as a resource When I was able to tag things super fast were some of my most satisfying moments

The Phone
This was a wonderful inuniverse way of grounding us to a certain moment in time and to give real information to the players

Conclusion
Earlier I mentioned I didnt regret this purchase but as you can see I do not recommend this game I really want Team Reptile to either add more content to this game or I want them to make a sequel and work out the kinks that a new product like BRC is bound to have Supporting them is a huge part of allowing companies to take risks like this so while I wish the game was twice as long I want them to have my money so they can keep on keeping on So much of the fundamentals are within reach and with BRC as a baseline I am hopeful they see the excitement and buzz a game like this has created and that the fanbase is hungry for more I was so ready to fall in love with this game but being honest I cant be so blinded by nostalgia when so many issues are so flagrantly present

What little time I got to enjoy BRC was mostly a good time but there wasnt nearly enough of it I really want Team Reptile to take the lessons learned from this release and up the ante whenever they decide to revisit the world of New Amsterdam Ill be more hesitant after these missteps but I am hopeful they can course correct given time and love",neg
1353230,"I had fun with this game and I would recommend it at a lower pricetag The current pricetag is a little too steep to warrant a positive review though This rings true for the entirety of the game which shows a lot of promise but left me wanting more in basically every aspect of gameplay

The music is great but theres just not enough tracks At eight hours of playing I know them all by heart

The trick system is fun but once you learn how to extend your combos indefinitely theres little
challenge to it anymore

The story is intruiging but undercooked Characters lack an overall depth and context that makes them feel like decor to a world that is really just meant to be a big skatepark There are some genuinely good moments in cutscenes but also some bizarre headscratching transitions and tonal shifts  spoiler A sniper runs up to you shoots you at point blank range then gets hit with a baseball bat by one of the bystanders who somehow didnt see them coming in the first place Turns out you only have a light concussion Maybe this is meant to be humorous but the overall tone of the game isnt really that ligthhearted at all spoiler 

The overall gameplay skating around and doing tricks is great until police starts to turn up in greater and greater numbers requiring you to interrupt what youre doing and essentially buttonmash them away They keep respawning too Because its not actually that difficult to kill police they feel more like a constant mild annoyance than an actual challenge The lack of easy ways to get rid of them heightens this problem

All in all Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is a very enjoyable game that does not live up to its full potential",neg
1353230,I think this game is not as good as For Honor F Get mad haters For I am a proud For Honor Player BTW Rainbow Six Siege clears low diff not to mention Valorant and Genshin Impact,neg
1353230,"Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is everything you want in a Jet Radio spiritual successor dripping with style an interesting world smooth controls and an eargasmic soundtrack Yes everything youd want except a satisfying gameplay loop

The problem isnt that that Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is not an arcadey race the clock highscoring graffitiemup itd be fine if it kept the stylish trappings of its inspiration but went a different way with the core mechanics and challenge It feels like the game left out the game entirely

Most charitably Bomb Rush Cyberfunks core game is a 3D Platformer Collectathon but instead of collecting Power Moons or Jiggies the game is figuring out how to reach the tagging spots scattered throughout the level as well as the occasional music track costume or graffiti style It also throws in the occasional trick combo scoring challenge and boss fight to mix it up but neither of those are particularly interesting for reasons Ill explain Its all just a bit boring

Tricks and Combos and Scoring This is the closest the game gets to a clever mechanic  you rack up combo multiplier by stringing elements together specifically wall runs ramps and sharp corners with each unique element only counting once If youre not on an element you have a limited time to manual to a new one or the combo ends encouraging you to scout the stage for a line that combos as much new stuff as possible 

Unfortunately the game faceplants this mechanic in two ways First it quickly teaches a mechanic that lets you manual infinitely eliminating the challenge of finding a tight line through the stage Second theres no downside to repeating an element just no new multiplier In almost every challenge its enough to hit a 10x20x multiplier from rail corners and then just grind a single loop forever while mashing buttons so you dont risk losing combo It would have been much stronger if the game focused on stringing as many elements including graffitti spots which are hardly rewarded in a combo without repeat as the stages are clearly designed for lines like that

Combat Boost into things and kick them If its a machine kick it and graffiti it Theres a fun mechanic where you can tag a cop the moment you deal the killing blow to it but the window is very small and theres no reward for doing it If the game forced you to tag police to defeat them it would have been unique and interesting but here its just a silly nod

Besides outside of the four or so very short boss fights the police element is pointless In the Jet Radio games the police presence got worse as the stage wore on and they could interrupt your tags requiring you to frantically put enough distance between you and them to get your tag in before they could catch you then book it under the gun of the clock In Bomb Rush Cyberfunk theres no stage timer and no risk of cops interrupting your work making them just kind of annoying when they spawn And the mechanic is rendered entirely pointless by the fact that you can clear all police presence by touching a bathroom so the mechanic might as well not have been included at all during free stage exploration

Characters In the Jet Radio games different characters had different stats like health and graffiti combo length that affected scoring and strategy In Bomb Rush Cyberfunk they all look different It feels like a mechanic introduced just because the Jet Radio games had them and not because it adds anything

In conclusion Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is an homage to everything you remember about the Jet Radio games minus the game While I did enjoy my time with it just for the style alone I honestly cant recommend it to anyone  theres not enough interesting gameplay here to attract anyone not familiar with its inspiration and for fans of the inspiration the game feels like a shell of what its inspired by If I could give it a thumbsmiddle I might but not at 40",neg
1353230,"This game is phenomenal the JSR vibe is captured perfectly with some added movement options to give you more control as you tear through the zones The graffiti mechanic in my opinion is an upgrade with all unlocked art immediately and always available the challenge being learning the inputs to your favorites And of course the soundtrack nonstop slaps

But with the 40 price tag I cant currently recommend it There are some features that are nonexistent for zero reason a painful one being manual saves meaning as of the time I put up this review odds are you will inevitably lose an hour or two of progress There are some easy ways to softlock yourself make sure in any followchase sequence you complete in its entirety including moving areas before doing any side stuff you can accidentally unload key progression points The keybinds are very minimal which could be fine if controller binds worked as intended but menuing doesnt work properly on a Dualsense controller There are some smaller things a retry option on the minute long challenges would be nice you cant change characters at your base and heat builds up way too quick All that aside tho this game can absolutely be enjoyed and again is a phenomenal game but imma wait to give it the ol thumbs up until some fixes happen",neg

1353230,"As someone who truly loved Jet Set Radio  Future as a kid it hurts to say this but I wish I had taken off the rose tinted nostalgia glasses before the 2 hour mark and requested a refund 40 is too much for this game If I had caught it on sale for 20 the value may have warranted a positive review But as it stands I dont recommend this one unless youve wasted 20 years fiending for that next JSRF fix even then youll most likely be left wanting

For a bit of reference I spent at least one youthful summer skating around town listening to the JSRF OST Id downloaded from limewire practically nonstop Ive had that same soundtrack on every music player or hard drive Ive owned since I learned to skate because of those games Ive held onto my Dreamcast and XBOX for this stuff As a partially rehabilitated Sega fanboy Id begrudgingly accepted the fact that Sega does not care about their IPs and leaves all the good ones to rot

So when Team Reptile dropped the first BRC trailer over THREE YEARS AGO I was stoked Then they dropped the movestyle trailer a few months latersploosh Then time passed 

Loading in the game throws a heavy R2 attack of nostalgia with their own unique twists I loved the little mix up of the main menu not making a sound until youve already landed on the second screen The vibes are really nice and the whole aesthetic is pleasing The very early game moves along pretty well the controls seem fluid and communicative the tagging system is pretty decent and artwork is top notch The characters seem decent but I was disappointed by the silence while communicating with them its 2023 ffs I understand voice acting must be expensive but come on Even scratching like Katamari would have taken this up so many notches And who cares if you rip off someone elsesConceptof Love The truth will set you free 

Youll eventually come across some areas you just cant reach or access You try approaching from every angle leaning into every rail turn to maximize your speed bouncing off vehicles billboard wallrides try numerous timings for boost jumping only to later learn on youtube that it requires a basic mechanic that isnt explained ANYWHERE within the game A super quick mini tutorial or even just an info panel could clarify some important missed info and minimize unnecessary frustration

After I had a couple hours to relax with the game and find its groove I broke it The movement system while feeling fluid is way too simple and easy once you grasp a couple moves The ability to chain combos with a basic manual requiring no corrective action removes any sense of skill requirement or accomplishment that might have been present A balance mechanic might make this feel a bit more involved

The objectivesgoals dont flow well In one instance a member of another crew challenges you to follow a route in which you get a quick and easy 5x multiplier the very next task if that same character challenging you to a 25000 score combo Youre started off pointing in the exact direction to approach a rail from the previous combo it takes 3 seconds to get back on that rail and youll absolutely smash that score Way too EZ

Combat is not enjoyable At all Youve most likely seen it by now use one of 3 attacks or 1 special move to launch them skyward spray paint them finally knock them out or some of them might just freeze then another wave will spawn Gotta smash Y or boost to break those stupid chains Maybe Ive been spoiled with Elden Ring but I just straight up avoid combat at all costs at this point The boss fights are simply obnoxious not challenging in an enjoying way whatsoever

It feels like in the three years since they released that first trailer they didnt ask anyone who tested the game how it feels as a whole There are a lot of cool aspects but the implementation is so disjointed that it feels noticeably incomplete I kept waiting for a moment when the immersion would pull me in but it hasnt happened yet Cut scenes become repetitive real quick and dont transition smoothly Maybe I havent progressed far enough but I dont think anyone Ive unlocked shows up in the hideout which is lame Traversing feels odd compared to JSR as its hard to find a flow that doesnt feel like a cheese fest due to the manual mechanic The map sucks I dont think you can view it full screen even on the phone and you have to find an item to show anything useful on the map in each borough But being able to move with it open is convenient Really what were you guys doing on this for three years since the first trailer and everything looks exactly the same

THE WORST OFFENDER IS HOW THE GAME WILL GET STUCK PLAYING THE SAME REPETITIVE SUBPAR SONG ON A LOOP UNTIL YOU WHIP OUT YOUR PHONE AND MAKE IT STOP As a game clearly inspired by JSRF how can you screw up the basic concept of a playlist so thoroughly Some of the songs seem pretty good but itll take a few listens to really notice But FFS just let it play another song without requiring your input

Genuinely high point of the game for me so far WHO TF EXPECTED GUS FROM RECESS WOULD TURN INTO DR FRANKENSTEIN

TLDR The spiritual successor to a great Sega IP could have gone a lot worseremember Shenmues fate I really wanted to support a small team working on a love letter to a great game but Id advise skipping this one until its deeply discounted or the dev team makes some notable QOL and gameplay improvements",neg

1353230,"Games worth about 2030 hours if youre going for 100 completion but otherwise youll likely only get about 812 hours worth from the story and a lot of the story is wasted on repetitive cut scenes and a serviceable story 

For most people Id honestly recommend waiting for a sale to make it worth it The game is a TON of fun but at 40 its not really worth the intro price it offers for its main content but with a sale of 2040 off itd be very much so worth it to buy the game 

The trick system is very shallow very easy to maintain and get a ridiculously high score Once you understand the systems its honestly just yourself sabotaging yourself if you manage to lose a good chain or you hit a set of stairs Which autoforce you off your skates regardless if you land on the flat part or the actual stairs themselves Once you get the combo system down all the challenge of movement goes out the window 

But part of the problem comes from the lack of clarity of various mechanics Theres a lot of people that dont know you can use Inline Skates to break glass by gliding on it beneath you or that you can use a skateboard on firehydrants to get extra air That bicycles open unique garages or that running has a singular attack Carthweel that chains into a superjump for getting over  on top of obstacles The complete lack of clarity and ambiguity the game left in these regards means you might be frustrated until you find the answer yourself through sheer luck or by looking up an answer to it online

The game feels like it really missed out from genuine QoL testing and a lack of understanding Everytime youre bombing an area youll be constantly forced to rewatch the same introduction cutscene The minimap is abysmal at best not marking anything of import on it even once you obtain the map Bathroom stalls are used to change your outfit as well as to dump infamy to get the police off you Cipher gatherings are supposed to change characters and Taxi locations dont autounlock based on area meaning you likely wont unlock the Taxis until you want to use one in the postgame only to find that you havent unlocked any because the usual expectation that the fast travel system would be a baseline unlock actually requires you to do so individually And also to find them 

But nothing important is put on the map itself aside from tag spots once you unlock the map Theres no effective way of tracking your collectibles youve gathered Theres constant glitches on points for bombing each area 

Not only that the story really only focuses on a small group Theres a few obscure optional characters but unlike JSRF you never really feel like theyre part of the process of playing rather they feel like outoftheway optional sidequests with trivially easy objectives to complete They dont show up in your hideout which is a real bummer because genuinely your hideout feels desolate and empty 

Light Edit here Recently the characters Ive had unlocked HAVE started to appear in the hideout Not sure why they didnt before Place still feels empty but its a nice improvement regardless that a number are there now

Unfortunately the game has a huge lack of genuine challenge to it due to how easy it is to gather points in each area the characters themselves are pretty lackluster overall and the cast  while at endgame is rather diverse you likely wont really be playing as anyone other than the titular three you see from the get go I cant in good faith recommend the game at 40 but at about 30 I think itd be a good indie dev game If you really love JSRF it would be a great title to add to your collection but be ready for the fair number of bugs and frustrqation with key mechanics that may come with it 

Its still a good fun ride either way",neg
1353230,"Ive had a major issue with a glitch where the character runs forward constantly where i can do nothing unless i quit Ill play for a while just to lose all my progress It wouldnt bother me if it wasnt so frequent throughout the game some save points would put a bandaid on this but i think it borderline makes the game unplayable because of how frustrating it is to play for an hour getting progress for nothing 

My other gripe is the bike What the hell why make special ares for the bike only when you dont even tell me i cant switch back until later Here i am thinking itd be cool to switch for a bit to one of the other rides only to realise im an idiot and now have to backtrack later for certain items I dont care that the bike unlocks later so much as i dislike it doesnt even warn you that itll be gone for a while when switching It makes me question if you even beta tested the game at all with all the problems Ive been having 

Such an amazing game in every other way Its only because i love the game that i even care so much I grew up playing JSRF on the Xbox and so you could say Ive been waiting almost 20 years for this So to have this much trouble made me sad to say the least I had some hope of getting the bike back with the DLC but sadly you chose to add the blades and board when the bike is the most useful Good job though its an amazing game Ill gladly change my review if you can sort these changes out but til then ill recommend people wait til its more polished",neg
1353230,"I did not have fun

I expected a fast paced free flowing and vibrant environmentscharacters and just ended up disappointed by the lack of thought seemingly put into making grinding around the maps interesting rather than extremely linear and repetitive Combat sucks massive balls and is not skippable combo mechanics are absolutely mindless cutscenes are a bore and severely slow everything felt way too easy tagging is whatever All that could be solved I think but I doubt it will

Redeeming feature is the art and music although a bit random and I wish were more thematic based on the environment

The game feels like it has been put together very quickly and was afraid to be innovative to avoid weirding out the core fan base  Those people seem exceedingly happy though so thats great but it wasnt for me and thats alright",neg
1353230,"Heartbreaking

The style is so good but unlike Jet Set which was super hard every challenge in this game is easy  Were the developers afraid of ruining the playthrough  The only fight I lost was when I fell through the floor into the subocean

Sluggish cutscenes drain the excitement out of the story most of the music is pretty lowkey and the Tony Hawk style gameplay is made tedious by the fact its nearimpossible to drop your combo  Just find a circular railing and grind for two minutes to clear the gang showdowns the only part of the experience that features a challenge  Then spend another hour doing repetitive challenges spray painting tags with the same five patterns and playing Horse with random gang members  It feels like the game just never came together

The Oldschool judges are sick though",neg
1353230,"Bum Rush Clusterfuck

Tryce really needs to pee yo

Refunded",neg
1353230,"The ending of a game impacts how youre left feeling about it Even if the experience up to the end was good an obnoxious ending can sour the entire experience I say this genuinely I would recommend this game if youre only going to play the story and dont care about completionism but that may be a hard sell at the games current price

I love JSRF I enjoyed BRC I loved the story mostly I loved the art mostly I loved the areas mostly And the game functions very well Mostly

Until the post game

The story is pretty good I wont spoil anything but its got fun discovery and twists to it I genuinely enjoyed going through it with each little surprise But theres two parts that are so awkward that it simply takes me out of the story entirely There is a character named Escher who is portrayed as thoughtful and important This isnt a spoiler He vanishes from the story Just evaporates Gone Hes not even an unlockable character He just exits the game abruptly

The other is the DJ Cyber fight a boss battle built up to for a while Clunky and miserable Its also not immediately clear what youre supposed to do the first instinct being dodge and approach Overall an exhaustive test of patience I have nothing good to say about that fight at all

The arts great the more grounded characters are awesome Red Tryce Bel Vinyl and most enemies all look great But then down a peg we have Felix Shine Coil Solace Mesh Rise who are stuck between more grounded designs and over the top becoming unappealing for being stuck in between Theyre not pleasant to look at because they cant commit either way And then theres Rave and The Flesh Prince who are just purely eye sores Escher was a rather cool looking character but because the writer forgot he was even in the game hes not unlockable

JSRF had a lot of characters a lot of them grounded punk designs and a bunch of them also just plainly over the top Each one had its own enjoyable aspects For BRC when your choice is a lot more limited it makes you analyze what your choices are a lot more since there might not be a case of just play the one you like a lot In my case I would have just used Escher and ignored this mostly but he literally got Thanosd out leaving me analyzing everyone else Not only that but Faux is also not playable despite being playable at the start It doesnt need to make sense Rokaku was playable by the end of JSRF Let the player have fun The lack of characters really gives me aches

The maps are all very distinct and colorful and nice Except the mall is just needlessly huge Unironically you could scale the big round area down to half its size and you would not have any downsides gameplay wise The same could be said about the Mataan River area where it is just a long stretch of nothing everything so vastly spaced apart You could easily crush everything closer together and have a whole upper layer of wires and make it more enjoyable but missed out on that entirely too I enjoyed Mataan then I had to do things there

These are some basic issues that some QA would have helped greatly before release


Im going to quickly say what I do like about it The graffiti system is great and the art associated with it is wonderful The phone is great very immersive and useful tool and giving it a camera was impressive and fun to play with Even the ability to change music The combo system is leagues above what JSRFs was It takes everything good about JSRF gameplay wise and simply tweaks it to be faster more in depth and more fun Plus mostly look better Music Fantastic 2 Mello is the highlight of the soundtrack for sure I Wanna Kno is awesome


But heres my quitting moment what just became too frustrating UI after the story Genuinely catastrophic practically hostile to the player

How do you change characters
You need to stop at a black and white checked spot and dance

Can you do this in your Hideout
No there is no way to change characters in your characters base This means you need to stop and dance at a taxi spot

Do taxi spots unlock when you go near them
No you have to interact with them each specifically Seeing them isnt good enough

Can you talk to characters to change to them in the Hideout
No only side characters will offer to be swapped to Main characters will only do their post game dialogue and recruited enemies will not even be in the Hideout to talk to Only the ugly ones can be swapped to in the Hideout alone

Can you change outfits while changing characters
No you need to select a character then go to an outhouse to change Adding to that the outhouse cannot be used a second time so to change multiple characters outfits you have to reload the area multiple times

Can you change gear while changing characters
No you cannot You need to first leave the Hideout to another area so you can change your character then return back to the Hideout because the Hideout is the only place you can change your gear

Further more you need to also do this for an achievement a unique spray on every taggable spot Small tags are by character and the Hideout is small so its the easiest place to do it in and keep track of every tag Too bad you cant change characters in the Hideout right

Customizing more than one character becomes this loop find square take time to start dancing select character skip dance intro find taxi spot which may not be close at all to square take more time to start dancing go to an outhouse and select colors go to the floor of the gear you want and select the gears look go back to the taxi spot start dancing AGAIN go all the way back to the square you started at START DANCING AGAIN select your character

To call this tedious would be polite

Does the game at least tell you how many unlockables are left in an area
Of course not



To close off I really enjoyed the game so long as youre stuck playing Red and dont need to worry about any of that All the challenges and customizations are way off and dont need to be worried about until post game If you do buy the game just enjoy the story and skip anything after I was very excited for this game but I am horribly disappointed by such awful basic mistakes in UI design This is why you hire someone to do QA Literally this Anyone could have caught this

Wait for a QoL patch",neg
1353230,"This game initially made me swell with JSRF nostalgia and I give a lot of credit to the creators for preserving the cellshaded art style funky vibe and choosing a tracklist that feels both modern and retro like the original 

My problem is I think its too easy to the point of mundane The mechanics  tricks system just doesnt feel good and I dont like the crew combo battles or fights against the police I just dont see how youre supposed to have fun in those sequences they just feel like some obligatory action The maps are ok but dont make me want to explore them or race around them in a loop as fast as possible

Overall I feel like the devs did an okay job and the game is fixable if they patch the weaker aspects of the game Ill say do not recommend for the 10 version",neg
1353230,"Ill almost definitely change this review later if these issues get fixed because the main game is actually very fun QoL is the real problem just dragging this game down enough for me to give it a negative review

Taxi fast travel points character swap spots and stations for losing heat and changing color palette do not appear on the map arent highlighted in any way that would make them stand out and theres so few of them that I often have to travel back to the hub manually to change something 

Losing heat is near impossible if you dont have the portapotties memorized and you cant change characters if you have any heat at all 
The hub has two portapotties which are both one use for changing color palettes so you have to walk out through a loading screen and step back in to change more characters

The games secrets are all found by having a specific movestyle on a character which means youll just have to go find a portapotty to lose heat hope you remember where that is then go find the only cypher on the map to swap characters then go find that secret again after all that with the proper moveset

And just like everything else Ive mentioned theres no map indicators for any of it and they do not stand out at all so good luck finding each normal unmarked dull taxi sign in the expansive levels Once you do find them hope you can remember where each and every one is without seeing it on the map cause you can only fast travel from them as well

I feel like all of these issues need major changes such as just letting us change characters and palettes on the go anywhere let us call the taxi and fast travel from anywhere have heat go down on its own or add like quadruple the portapotties there are now and show them on the map on top of making it stand out better

The only other negative thing I feel about this game is that Ill probably only get about 57 more hours out of this 40 dollar game and all of that will just be looking for secrets and a few characters Im not going to use

EDIT
Honestly the 40 dollar price tag is a bigger issue than I thought originally writing this review The fact that theres day 1 DLC on top of this that really doesnt offer anything that shouldnt have just been in the game already Then theres the issue of the amount of playtime and enjoyment I got out of it 20 hours is probably the max I think anyone would be able to play this game for and 10 of those hours are going to involve scouring the side walls of every level for a secret that just involves equipping the bike and standing in front of a big door with a bike symbol on it and then collecting the thing inside The main gameplay loop just isnt fun after the story is finished and even during its just a watered down jet set radio clone that doesnt try anything too out there not even going as out there as jet set radio didnt add any QoL to at least make just booting up the game to trick around any fun Buy it on sale if youre nostalgic for JSR for 1015 hours of not very replayable fun that kinda runs its course by the end with limited movement tech on linear samey maps",neg
1353230,Went into this game thinking it would be more technical Booting it up and finding out you only have 3 tricks was pretty sad definitely after hoping this game would take over THPS for me Simplicity and hand holding in combos really just shuts down the want and need to improve in this game seems like anyone can pick up a controller and lay down an easy 200 trick combo which may be fine for some but for me it was not what I was looking for,neg
1353230,"I was so excited that the devs of JSRF were coming back to bring this game back I played JSRF for hours and I would never get bored I was hoping that with the timeline of development in this game it was going to be faster more intuitive and just as fun if not more and I was severely disappointed within the hour

The maps are huge with not nearly as many obstacles or grind opportunities There isnt as many pedestrians as the original game and part of the fun was messing around with them The new graffiti system is pretty finicky and the fact that it doesnt have controller support is another grievance considering their origins was on controller PS1XBOX Original Dialogue feels empty plot is dry and uncompelling Game feels like its made for kids 10 and under Maybe I am not the target market but considering they knew one of the bigger purchasers for this game would be the fans of the JSR and JSRF I feel severely disappointed and unfulfilled I wouldve rather had more small maps than less large maps Wouldnt recommend to JSRF fans",neg

1171690,"boohoo go wait in queue
game good",pos
1171690,"I choose to only review the game and not EA and the server problems

I think combat is very good
The world looks beautiful
Housing can be good
Dungeons are fun and entertaining

Theres a lot I still dont quite know how it works or how it all fits together but its a game I find myself thinking about when Im not playing it That is usually a good thing and Im looking forward to the continuation",pos
1171690,"I tried to review this game with the least bias I can There are too many people review bombing because they are mad they got kicked from queue and quite a few white knights defending the game as well I think AS has built a great foundation for a solid game with room for lots of additional content and variety however the game as it is has several flaws especially technical ones Hopefully the get fixed in time


Pros 

1 Visuals look great animations are fluid and the areas are dense with objects and detail making them feel much more immersive However I am expecting some people to dislike the somewhat cartoony graphics this comes down to preference

2 Combat has to be the best part about this game It feels like a simplified more forgiving Dark Souls with some raidlike mechanics thrown into the mix It has a great foundation and I strongly recommend new players to mess around mixing light and heavy attacks jump attacks and animation canceling with guard and abilities Mashing left click will give you a boring experience I have little to no experience with guns so I cannot talk about those

3 The game has a lot of variety This games progression and build system is almost identical to Warframe you can obtain multiple Wayfinders slot in echoes basically mods and equip a unique weapon for a variety of combinations that suit your style The game just went into early access so there isnt that much at the moment but I am expecting several new Wayfinders and weapons in the future 

4 Boss fights are amazing The initial few dont have much going for them but as you progress you encounter various bosses with various mechanics So far all of them felt unique and fair but challenging

Cons

IMPORTANT
1 I personally think the monetization for this game is very friendly however the game is P2W I personally dont mind p2w in pve games but I see too many people trying to defend the game as not p2w First of all all Wayfinders and weapons are purchasable from the cash shop Wayfinders all excel in different areas and I dont think any are directly superior to others so its more of an access to variety issue but some weapons seem to be downright stronger than others while the stronger higher rarity weapons are much more difficult to farm People defend this by saying you still have to level the weapon after buying it but leveling a weapon doesnt take much time and you are still skipping the very lengthy initial grind to obtain the weapon Also the reward tower battle pass has several resources that can help you progress in the game I am not sure if these exist for both the free and paid version but people can buy keys to gain access to all of them instantly All this being said the depth of p2w is very shallow spending money will give you more options and a head start at best and no matter how much you spend you will never reach a point a free player cant but by definition I do think this is still p2w

2 There are several technical issues and this is what most people have been upset about including myself Launch was an absolute disaster but the game has stabilized a bit and queue times are far shorter now However I have encountered several bugs some of them forcing me to quit and requeue again and there are also occasional disconnects which seem to be decreasing in frequency Also the game has some lengthy loading times and for a game that constantly sends you between dungeontownopen world I found this to be a little annoying

3 Combat can feel a bit shallow especially in the beginning I mentioned combat as a pro but I think it definitely has room to add more depth in what the player can do to damage enemies Wayfinders only have 4 abilities and weapons only have 1 for a total of 5 abilities You do have access to light heavy jump counter attacks parry and guard but I would like to see some more unique gameplay outside of the basic moves Hopefully additional Wayfinders and weapons will fix this issue in the future

4 Story is delivered poorly I ended up skipping most of it so I dont actually know if the story is good or not but the way the story is presented is primarily just an npc explaining everything to you with some voice acting and a dialogue box There are occasional cutscenes which were cool but overall it does a poor job of immersing you into the story


Overall I have enjoyed this game and I see a lot of potential for it to grow in the future however there are several issues as of now If you want a smooth gameplay experience I recommend you wait until the technical issues get resolved but if you are dying to try the game 20 seems like a fair price for the experience you will get now",pos

1171690,"Although the game is certainly Early Access and there has been an awful queue problem The game is very fun once you are rolling in it
I think once the servers are stable and bug fixes will flow out galore well be able to see what this studio can really do

My biggest fears is the progression system having major clogging points without spending a little 
If a well priced season pass drops every few months with a decent grind that would be preferred",pos

1171690,Fixed their server issues Published by DE warframe and rough around the edges just like their game was when it released into early access Good gameplay loop,pos
1171690,"First of all yes queue times bad some connection issues The reality is that right now queue times are about 30 mins as of Augus 23rd about a week after launch This is an EARLY ACCESS game thats not slated for a full release for 6 monthss iirc subject to change The dev team have been very open and communicative of their progress on reducing queue times and it has worked 

The game itself is good its definitely early access as in certain NPC models are all the same and there may be a few funny bugs here and there but the only game breaking issue would be the occasional disconnect once again a server issue

Outside of those two the game is good Combat is fun and interactive progression feels good and the dungeon crawling is a refreshing experience with the Imbuement system 

The mtx is a slight problem as the weapons can either be 100 grinded for or purchased outright but this is not a PVP game so I dont feel like thats a huge issue

Overall yes this game has had a rough launch but everyone is forgetting that A this is early access B everyone is review bombing this game because of the server issues due to more players than expected wanting to play the game despite developers working around the clock to fix them",pos

1938090,bad movement bad killing time everything is bad,neg
1938090,The game is good but every single time I try to connect to a game it disconnects my WiFi from my computer and every other game doesnt do anything it lets me play and its not anything to do with my WiFi because I have multiple WiFi extenders around my home and when Im nobody else is using the internet it still doesnt work I just want to play DMZ bro,neg

1938090,"The game is rigged against you in every way From the matchmaking actively matching you with people hand picked from across the world the algorithms and patents Activision has running in the background to create that casino effect to keep you coming back for more the next game will be the winand it never is To the gun fights  if you are trash at the game dont worry Activision will help you when you cant shoot the broad side of a barn Activision will make your enemies hit box larger for you mean while they make your smaller to protect you You will also do more damage then a player who is better then you all the while they do less damage because they are more accurate then you So the better player must be constantly punished for simply being better then the player you are playing against Activision will buff players health speed damage and everything in between to make you think that the skin that just killed you is OP and that you need to buy it because you simply cant win against that skin and Activision wants you to buy it so they profit Also activision also said this would be a 2 year game and development cycle THEY LIED MW3 will be released this year claiming to bring back things that were taken from us in the beginning that should have never happened in the first place

Not to mention the AMOUNT OF CHEATERS THAT ARE IN THIS GAME THE GAME IS A JOKE 

1010 DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR YOUR SANITY AND MENTAL WELL BEING",neg
1938090,So many indie devs actually care about their fanbase you can tell Activision really could care less go buy Battlebit or download Polygon for free youll have much more fun with MP there,neg

1172470,I mean its an alright game where theres just a learning curve No paywalls so to speak as the only thing you can really purchase is cosmetic All in all its a decent Battle Royale cant complain,pos
1172470,"One of the best if not THE best BR game out there

Biggest issue is the skill based matchmaking which is total BS because all the top dogs use VPNs and will just stomp you 
If you havent been playing since day 1 and EVERY SINGLE ING DAY SINCE Good luck staying competitive",pos

1172470,game is shit,neg
1172470,Unplayable via Steam corrupts your save on load and makes the damn thing unlaunchable via any method Not that im missing out on much adding so much garbage like making voice lines gender neutral Stay away from this sweatfest and show Respawn that Titanfall 3 was what everyone wanted not this horrible woke garbage game,neg
1172470,"I love this game solo q is rough if youre trying to rank up but the movement of Respawns games have always been amazing 

I cannot recommend this game to new players Even with the addition of the intro lobbies that are supposed to be new user friendly ie filled with bots as soon as youre out of it you will get stomped by high ranking preds and master ranked players regardless of the game mode The learning curve is steep and the community makes it steeper Smurfing is rampant and always will be and even if it werent an issue matchmaking will always put you in lobbies with someone whos macros and soft aim bot make them impossible to hit while theyre zeroed in on your forehead or predator ranked players 

If youre playing with friends it gets worse because matchmaking also prioritizes putting you with other 3 stacks who are all usually Master or higher",neg

1172470,We all hate ourselves,neg
1172470,Respawns gunplay and movement are simply unmatched No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound feel and look as good as the guns in Apex It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex Its truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer However heres a big and stinky but EA These two letters when put next to each other strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers The game is currently riddled with bugs hackers a scamdominated meta stale game modes pisspoor matchmaking and more What does EA make respawn focus on instead Pumping out more skins and collection events This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard with recolored skins littering the shop and events Meanwhile Mobile has 3 more legends than us a highly  and I mean HIGHLY  requested team deathmatch mode and tons of other cool features that the consolePC versions can only have wet dreams about Thank you EA You truly have the reverse Midas touch where everything you touch turns into piles of doodoo,neg
1172470,Apex Legends is a disappointing game that fails to live up to the hype The graphics are bland and uninspired the controls are clunky and unresponsive and the gameplay is repetitive and boring The selection of weapons and characters is limited and the matchmaking system is unreliable frequently matching players with people who are much higher or lower level than they are The ingame microtransactions are also a major problem as players are constantly bombarded with ads for new skins weapons and other cosmetic items Overall I wouldnt recommend Apex Legends to anyone looking for a fun and engaging multiplayer experience,neg
1172470,they never fix the game,neg
1172470,Respawn is not the same company that made Titanfall 2 anymore This is published by EA so you know theres no real progression unless you spend ungodly amounts of money for skins that dont look good You would think for a game with such good movement EA would realize how good this game could be Unfortunately the pros in this game arent good enough to move to another game and any new players immediately leave because this game also lags like crazy There is literally no reason to play this game I have played it since launch and its not like its gotten a 20 or health update to the game Im begging you please just dont play this game But if you do add me I guess,neg
1172470,Almost fun but EA just wants your money and it shows,neg

1172470,"I thought the game would be fun even bought the character package as a start 21 hours in not a single kill and I only managed to get in around 13 minutes on one match because we didnt land in a popular spot  There is absolutely no learning curve youre either good at the start or youre wasting your time in queue for no reason   
   I dont wont and cant see recommending a game that doesnt provide matchmaking for similar experience levels  I made it to level 2 going against level 130s or even level 20s is downright slaughter  As stated youre either already good at the game or its a waste of time andor money",neg
