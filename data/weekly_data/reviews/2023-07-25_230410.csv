"I've been playing Warframe since Gauss update, which is around 2019 or so. Awesome fast paced looter shooter game.

I don't usually play third person shooter games with photo-realistic design like these, but this one is an exception. The Warframe designs which are like bio mechas are amazing, the gameplay is really fun, and it's not just about the guns, it also have melees and warframes abilities, which combines into unique builds. You can also change your warframes functionalities like strength, durations and range with mods and such. The cinematic stories are phenomenal and I still praise them till this day. The game also has a lot of game modes, which we will also come to this later. The game also has amazingly friendly comunity as well. This game is FREE TO PLAY while having AAA game level of designs, and you can grind premium currency ingame pretty easily.

HOWEVER the game is quite grindy, which is the least worst thing on the list.
You want to play with new stuffs NOW, but you have to wait 3 days for it to finish crafting, which kills off the hype.
Every content updates brings you new game modes, which is another content island that has barely anything to do with the rest of the game, with materials that once you have everything you can craft with that materials will, with no doubt, never want to have anything to do with that game mode ever again. Although a lot of content updates adds a lot of refreshing new game modes and well, contents, they all feel so different that it feels like another game entirely. Every time.
The game also lacks a form of ""endgame content"". By that I don't mean sitting in Survival for 2 hours killing level 9999 foot soldiers. By that I mean actual hard bosses. Assassinate missions are a joke, the bosses are forgettable, save for Eidolons, Orbs and Ropalolyst, which are not available for majority of the player unless they grind really hard to unlock them, not to mention actually be able to beat them. Railjacks are fun for the first hour or so, but it's also another content island which you don't want to have anything to do with. Asides from those, Liches and Sisters hunts are actually quite fun, challenging and memorable as a boss, and does give some nice uses or Raijacks as their dramatic final confrontation. The new Orowyrm in Duviri Paradox is also quite something too, but wayy too easy.
I stopped playing Warframe around The New War, but it's still fun enough to keep me coming back to the game occasionally because of the fun gameplay, the mechanics deep under it keeps pushing me away, and every updates with new game modes keep getting me dumbfounded of what is going on and what to do every time I return.

TLDR: very fun game with fun gameplay, but once you look deeper, you will see a mess behind the mechanics.",True
cool game regret not playing and keeping up with it,True

this game is so enjoyable from the beginning. It's super fun and challenging. Although it's kinda hard sometimes but you can always ask for help from others player. I really recommend this game to everyone that likes a combat games with adventures because the character in this game is so cool and easy to learn.,True
Its uhh... A learning experience but still fun,True
"Damn! i got this game back during the Golden Age (2014) i had it on ps4 it was free and Rhino prime just came out! The black and gold rhino prime. So i bought the pack and sunk deeper and deeper into the game i Eventually lvl'd up high maybe 15 or so and i had then purchased nearly every warframe in the game. Now then then -- *deep immersive story* -*Loads of customisation options from weapons to skins, warframes and color pallets, ships, resources and more...HUGE shop*- Warframes are like action figures, each comes with a few ""powers"" u activate using simple button combos. *best 3rd person SPEED RUNNER space game i can think of. *great community and community chat support, *clans dojo's faction's and guilds. Fun alone or with multiplayer I consider warframe one of my daily's and my 2ND favourite video game. * constantly being worked on and updated, I give this game a full recommendation for anyone! *****",True

What, you wanna see some explanation as to why I'm not recommending this 
[strike]piece of cake
[/strike] game? Alright, I'll do my best to explain, but first a tiny note: if you are already playing Warframe and enjoying it - great! keep playing :)

At a first glance Warframe seemed to be fairly good and engaging game: visually it looks fine, gameplay is fast-paced and overall fun to play. Huge solar map and seeming existence of story creates an illusion of a deep well made game. But that doesn't last long and as soon as you dive deep into the game it reveals what it really all about: repetitive boring meaningless grind, spiced up with endless bugs, lack of structure, logic, and creativity.
Warframe has actually very little content to offer and whatever content is there is just shoved into players face with absolutely no explanation or guidance or preparation.
With the exception of a few story-missions and Plains of Eidolon all locations are just a random pile of pre-made ""tiles"" glued together during loading. ”Tiles” are rooms, and there are maybe a few dozens of them in each set. As a consequence missions look alike on different planets to the point when it's impossible to differentiate one from another. Considering that there are over 200 missions and only four main tile-sets, one for every enemy faction, with tiny variations for on-planet and in-space missions, soon I got sick of seeing same surroundings again and again.
Game modes can't boast of variety either: there are basically (again) four of them + a few modifiers. Um, correction: that is on paper there are four+change, in reality you’d be hard pressed to find difference between them as they feel and play rather identical. 
Adding insult to injury AI is extremely simplistic making enemies blindly run at the player in (sometimes) straight line. Cloak and they would act like nothing happened and no tenno was there. It's little to no fun or excitement dealing this such opponents. Often I felt sorry for them, however odd that sounds.
Now imagine all mentioned above multiplied by hundred or thousand. Sounds tempting, isn’t it? Once all quests are completed and all planets are ”explored” there is not much left to do: either further level up your Mastery Rank or customize your warframe (playable character) and equipment to its max. Leveling Mastery Rank up is simple: level up gear such as weapons, companions or warframes. Process of acquiring an item and then leveling it up is mindlessly simple and requires player to do same/similar mission over and over and over again until the goal is reached. Some stuff can be bought for real money, but process of leveling it up can’t be skipped.
And finally icing on this cake: bugs. Endless bugs. Every new big(or small) update brings bugs, often game breaking. A recent example Sanctuary Onslaught game essentially was crashing when host player disconnected – host migration was not working on release and devs fixed this issue almost a week later. What QA team was doing before the release remains a mystery. Assuming there is a quality assurance team employed at DE (devs)..

At the end of the day, Warframe can offer very simple stylish gameplay with no depth to it. If you are looking for more than that this game would feels just as fun as grinding wooden blocks with a sandpaper - for short sessions and/or with friends to keep distracted –  an okay experience, but playing it solo for a prolonged duration of time at once is just dreadful.

PS My experience is based on playing with Prime Access which costs like new AAA game and cuts in half leveling and credits* grind, plus gives platinum** and credits. Can’t imagine what it’s like to play the f2p-way the first time around.

PPS and I haven’t even touched atrocious boss fights, forsaken Index and Archwing modes, unbalanced rewards, absolutely annoying radio transmissions, amateur voice acting, glitching matchmaking, ""convenient"" trading with other players, lack of creativity or imagination when it comes to new stuff, confusing crafting/mods etc. There are a lot of things wrong and no hint on something getting right anytime soon – only more new stuff added, making game more and more chaotic.

*credits - in-game free currency.
**platinum or plat - premium currency.",False
"Shit game, people waste thair entire life on this game grinding forever and spending all thair money on stuipid fucking warframe skins that look like shit. fuck this game it eats your soul",False

Warframe. There was a point in my time with World of Warcraft that I just became bored the fantasy asthetic. I yearned for  the sci-fi, for space. I took a chance and played Mass Effect, long after it had been out, and was gobsmacked. ""How could I have missed this game!!"", I thought.  It strached that itched. But it was not enough. I needed more. I looked and looked until I found Totalbiscuts lets play of Warframe. And that was it. I had found my game. 

For a free to play game, it has one of the most fair models there is. If you have the time, play. If you don't, pay. The point of game is to play. It is your choice to use faux-money to by the in-game currency. Orrrrrrrr, you can just play the game. 
And if you are of a mind to, try to have some fun while you do it.

Pros-
Support and engagement: It would be hard pressed to say that they people that develope Warframe, Digital Extreme, lack any passion for this game. They are almost fanatical about it. Which in and of itself is a pro and a con. You forget where you started, see only the bright future, and very rarely fill in the cracks that develop along the way. 

I may have put too much into the idea that a developer would truly heed the calls by the player base. In the end they have to keep the lights on. And while that must be put first, without an ear to the people that are paying to keep the lights on, a developer may find the dog didn't just bite, but took the whole forearm off at the elbow.  

Game play- a nice blend of beat'em up and shooter in 3rd person perspective. I like to see myself in relationship to world around me. 

Cons-

Loot system- I am a big advocate of diablo style loot systems. Warframe could hands down benefit from this style system with a revamped crafting system. 

Parthian sTHOughT-
The push for end game- lt was in this game that learned that end game is what people look for when they want a reason to stop playing a game. That is really what endgame is. It is our push to escape the gravity of something that we have invested such a large amount of time in that we want that period at the end of the sentance. The high note, the touchdown, grand slam, the buzzer beater.  

Well what if the game had no end? What if we just played? How about we have more game? 

More game, less endgame.",False
"If I were to describe this game in one word, it would be: Repetitive.

Devs for some reason decided a while ago to start removing anything that was ""fun"" and not grindy, so no I can't recommend this game to anyone.
There are a ton of max lvl players, or lvl 18+ who sit around doing nothing no matter what, and the chat made for playing with other people always hosts negative, or players who have no interest in new players no matter what.

If you love grinding, no, don't get this game, because unless you're interested in using ""tricks"" or ""bugs"" to solo any of the endless modes, you won't be doing anything past quick endless missions, and that's the same as wasting a so called ""key"" for the higher maps, though you can also play the normal maps, for no real loot besides ""resources"" that you'll be using for crafting weapons and such. 
There are of course ""other"" things to do, like spend hours upon hours of grinding for rare items to sell for premium currency so you can join the ""fashionframe"", spending all your money on cosmetics so you can look cool like everyone else.

Is there anything redeeming? Not anymore no, anything that has been added has been kicked down into the dirt due to ""DE"", also known as the devs of this game for some reason thinking it was either overpowered, too easy or a third reason which makes even less sense.

AFK Farming? Impliment a broken AFK timer that completely nullifies any and all regen on your character until you press your dodge key.

A certain build requires very specific ""attributes"" to work but it makes you invincible and isn't fun to use all the time? Don't worry, DE's got you covered, completely change the character's abilities and attribute bonuses, that'll make everyone happy, right?

An ability can be upgraded to pull mob drops to you but still makes you build in a very specific way? Make the upgrade only affect the user, surely that'l lbe a good change, no one will dislike it!

I'm making it sound like it only affected characters, but even the weapons in the game suffer, and they suffer way too hard than you can possibly think, some weapons are just so insanely overpowered, some for a while, some have kept their spot for years, only beaten by newer versions of that weapon, and with this, some weapons are instantly thrown out of the window when some weapons hit the community, even with upgraded versions of the weapon the old ones are most likely thrown out on the spot.

Sure you can use any weapon you like, no one has the right to tell you to not use something just because another weapon is better, but if you aren't doing the damage you need to, and you want to play a tiny bit serious, you'll have to follow everyone else using the strong weapons and say goodbye to your ""cool"" or less popular weapons, no exceptions. 

The list goes on, to things that make even less sense, and even things that didn't make anything ""easy"" or ""stupid"" were changed because of DE's stupidity.
It's surprising this game isn't dead already, if you were here from the start, and still play, I feel very sorry for you.


Edit: I forgot to mention another big thing that completely ruined the game when I was talking about builds, multiple characters, or ""frames / warframes"" have been -completely- changed in how stats affect their abilities, meaning if you had a build from long ago that needed one set of mods, there's a big chance all those hours and items spent on getting the perfect ""build"" together will be completely wasted and you'll more or less have to do it all over. Never any compensation or at least a warning, I'm over 100% sure I'm not the only one that had to re-forma a few frames or discard it completely because of it. Sure, some playstyles or builds will always be good at one point and ""fall off"" or become much less effective at some point, but this was almost completely opposite of what you normally would use on certain characters before. Then there's the problem with mod points, either pay 20 ""premium currency"" for double mod points to upgrade your character with or save it for the prime version of the warframe, which will come, but might first come far in the future, leaving people with less time and money hanging around with characters unsuited for missions behind because they're saving that upgrade for the prime version. (Who by the way will always have some type of upgrade, either better or easier ways of modding correctly or having better survivability.",False

"Was excited to play this game.
Download 23gb file (Huge!) Then I waited 2 hours for an update that was going at 6-20kbps!
I had a look through their own game pages forums and this has been an issue for three years with a lot of people deciding to uninstall.
Just like me.
The developers obviously dont care much about how the game runs for all.
Great potential, just not acting on their debilitating problems.
