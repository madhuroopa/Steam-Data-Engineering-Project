"Recently they have made the game a cakewalk for killer an absolute nightmare for survivor if you're not queuing with people you know. Updates to address toxic behavior from killer or survivor are exceptionally slow to be added - Finally have rudimentary AI Bots when someone drops the game instead of insta-loss of character (debatable if loss of character is better).  Hit Connection Area for Killer to Survivor is huge - I've hit survivors through windows after they've landed safely and started running away. The build of the game currently rewards unfun play styles, especially on the survivor's end, but this is slowly being addressed.

With the above said, the game is still exceptionally fun when you play with a group of friends.",True
"I love this game I have it for Switch, ps5 and just now got it for pc but I hate how lately I've been having issues getting my Auric Cells after I purchase them. I don't mind spending money and not having cross progression with playstation but please make sure I get my Auric Cells...",True

"As much as I want to rag on this game and a vast majority of the community surrounding it, this has honest to god been a very fun gaming experience, with the ONLY caveat being that it is better with friends. Solo queue can be a frustrating journey sometimes, but the game is very fun in my book, plus the game is always getting new killers and survivors to keep the game fresh. Overall, worth the purchase",True
buy pig = fun,True
I love the concept of the game. I am a big fan of the horror genre and I love that they get licenses from the studios to incorporate the stars of the horror genre. I also like the original survivors and killers that they continue to create.,True
very fun if not playing as Cameron,True
"Fun game but don't go getting competitive. Live out your dreams of being a sadistic horror antagonist or a quivering victim desperately trying to escape.

Its basically horror movie themed hide and seek.",True

This game is the biggest waste of money and time. If you're smart you won't play it. The way the game is so killer sided now makes me want to commit toaster bath. I regret wasting my life away on this game. 0/10,False
this game fucking sucks,False
"Every now and then you'll have a good match, but so many games either put you up against a killer that facecamps you after putting you on hook, or teammates that give up and kill themselves on hook within the first few minutes of the game.  Or AFK people.  Or people, who, for whatever reason, run up to you, throw down a pallet, and speed vault repeatedly over it to give away your location.  And there's really nothing you can do about it, because if you have even one teammate that's throwing the game or AFK for a long period of time, you're pretty screwed.",False
this game stinks so bad,False
"I decided to play after a while and every second playing the game sounds started to fucking play like shoothing, walking speaches, the worst bug on a game like this",False

This game used to be fun but with players camping or abusing mechanics it's just frustrating and only having a rank mode isn't helping with any of the issues this game has. For me this game is only playable as a premade group of 5 nowadays.,False
"In a world, where this game actually is enjoyable and isnt just two literal retards jerking eachother off in the corner and then a random shitty killer getting a 4k because theres 2 hooks within cumshot distance",False
"Идея игры прекрасная, но абсолютно в 0 сломанный подбор игроков, я отсутствовал в игре 1.5 года, по возвращению у меня самый низкий ранг, я уже забыл и вообще зашёл повеселиться. Три игры подряд попадались команды на высоких рангах, которые после игры сильно токсичили.",False
"Devs are lazy and dont care, a lot of bugs that are still there forever now, no reconnect button and bans you instead.",False
"You know when you were a kid, you would chase someone around a table but they would just go the opposite direction from you, that's this game.",False

The game wont stop crashing on me. i will probably just delete it,False

"CONS This is probably the least scary horror game I have ever played and that is one of its selling points.. Out of my 18 hours of playing this game I got scared once. And it was by a glitch. The killer unlocking systems take way too long for people who are FTP. If you have money all you really need is to spend 20 dollars play the game a bit unlock good perks slap them on anyone and then you'll be winning matches left and right. The community for this game is awful, I have had multiple trolls come into my lobby and just wreck house. it seems you get a hacker 1 in every 15 games. And if your playing Survivor you'll be holding M1 on a generator for 70% of your time.

Now the PROS. There are a lot of good horror characters in this game. There's Micheal Myers Scream, Albert Wesker, Amanda from SAW and Bubba! All of the killers are different (enough) to be there own thing. Game can be fun as survivor and killer. If your playing against a good player the game can be pretty intense. Usually your survivor team is pretty good and they'll revive you and distract the killer when needed.

All in all I'll give this game a 6.5/10. If your looking for a game to try out and think you'll like it then give this game a try",False
"No idea what is going on in this game, except I gotta kill the survivors or escape the killer’s hunting ground depending on who you’re playing as. The concept sounds straightforward, but it’s the gameplay mechanics that is frustrating. Whoever came up with the idea of hitting each survivor twice to get them on the ground is an imbecile. I’m carrying an axe the size of a tree trunk and yet I got to hit each survivor twice to incapacitate them before dragging them to a hook to be sacrificed. Ludicrous that there is no ragdoll physics engine where if you hit them on the head they go down instantly. 

Trolls are rampant. I had a game where I chose to be the killer and literally all that was happening throughout that game was the survivors shining their flashlights at me blinding me. If I managed to hit one they all came doing that same thing before healing the wounded survivor. In the end, I got them all and they were all pissy about it and calling me a lowlife and a killjoy. 

There is always someone complaining in whatever server or match you play - there is that one player that challenges your style of play and then starts throwing cusses even if you’re playing normally.  

I don’t take this game seriously but the amount of tryhards in this game is making it toxic.

"This game-play loop is the most stupid thing I have had the displeasure of playing,
As a survivor you are doing quick time events while running around a empty map or if you get bored of that you decide to be a little shit and run a flashlight bullying the worst killer because the people playing good killers don't let you have a second of fun.
As a killer you either pick one that can actually play the game or get bullied by a bunch of survivors because if they aren't being little shits they are playing the worst rhythm game in existence or you get yourself a meta killer and suck any enjoyment you ever had away.

Don't be lured by any flashy promotions or crossover killers and survivors they add, the base game has and will continue to be unfun. safe your money and time.",False
"Pro :
- Addictif
- Killer look interessing and have different power
- Nick Cage

Con :
- Addictif
- Pay2Win
- No Matchmaking
- Lots of bugs
- Cheaters are commons in this game
- One of the most toxic community i have ever seen
- No balance and no intention to balance this ""party game""
- Last patch is so horrendous some killer aren't even playable

This is the kind of game that make you want to play it again but will make you absolutely miserable while doing so.
Overall i cannot recommend this game especially after recent update unless you're ready to be insulted and willing to wait hours to have a decent match.",False
Give us console to PC cross progression.,False
