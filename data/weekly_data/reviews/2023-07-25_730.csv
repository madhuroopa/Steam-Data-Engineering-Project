"Valve issued a Vac ban for no reason, thereby taking away my time and money spent on this game. Guys, out of everything possible, I had Geforce Experience and VPN running. I am ready to contact you and provide all possible evidence, only in case of an unban or refund for the Prime status and the total value of my inventory. Please don't waste my time. Thank you.",False
"*ITS WORTH THE LONG READ* I have been playing this game with my friend but we always got alot of cheaters in our lobbies and we get upset but all they tell us is that its okay for them to cheat bc we should just ""buy prime"" so i buy prime (which is non-refundable) and now i can't play with my friend bc the game would give him the high and mighty rank of silver 1(lowest in the game) meaning now i cant play with him bc of some HUGE RANK DIFF between us and in order to get on his GODLY level i have to win 9 more games (I'm unranked and just got the game) so i spent day in and day out grinding to get my rank up top fragging most of my games and sweating my ass of only to lose bc me and my lvl 3-4 teammates were put up against 5-10 year vets with 3-4 pages worth of service medals dating back to 2014 or farther. This has gone on for days now and i have only won one game and the rest haven't even cut it close i still need 8 more wins to even GET a rank. when we just try and play wingman (the only game mode me and my friend can play) it now tells him i have RED low trust which is synonymous with cheaters hence giving us extremely long wait times to play with other low trust players. so basically i paid to escape cheaters and ended up against them anyways. csgo purists say what you want but clearly the game is whats pushing people to cheat as much as they do. a lesser man than me in this scenario would've just downloaded whatever these mfs use in order to even THINK ab enjoying this game but I'm just gonna stop playing since clearly my $15 was a waste on this shit heap of a game that hasn't been enjoyable in a long ass time and im just gonna cut my losses and call it here, i should've known that if it was THAT bad to start with before i had low trust at all, it wasn't going to get better with a simple payment of $14.99. idk how i even get low trust since im pretty chill and have made some friends in my games and have never even bothered to research a cheat. but since then i haven't been able to even get a game whatsoever so fuck this",False
